As \\ncompanies seek real-time data to transform their supply \\nchains, AI and predictive analytics help capture insights \\nand react to changing conditions. Y our company is helping \\ncompanies reconfigure their supply chains to ensure that \\nthey can serve their customers and stakeholders on time.\\nLetter from the Chairman  |  6The change in technology consumption reflects \\nthe prevailing trends in the economy. Recent events \\nhave accelerated digital adoption, put the spotlight \\non supply chain resilience and added urgency to the \\nsustainability imperative. Each of these represents an \\nopportunity that can contribute towards the growth \\nof not just your company, but of the ecosystem as a \\nwhole.\\nDigital transformation is now an integral part of the \\nfunctioning of enterprises, governments and societies. \\nY our company continues to play a critical role in \\nthis transformation, helping clients embrace new \\ntechnologies, initially to cope with the crisis, and since \\nthen, to innovate at scale and grow their businesses. \\nAs a fitness enthusiast, I can tell you that the only \\nway to transform in the long term is by strengthening \\none’s core.

But the memories of TCSers and their \\nloved ones we lost during the year will forever remain \\nwith us. My thoughts and prayers are with everyone \\nwho endured the loss of friends and family members \\nto the pandemic.\\nGiven that context, I am grateful that on the business \\nfront we have much to feel happy about and celebrate. \\nIt has been a highly satisfactory year of consistently \\nstrong, profitable growth. In rupee terms, our revenue \\nwas `191,754 crore , which is growth of 16.8%  \\n(15.4%  in constant currency).\\nOur profitability continues to be industry-leading, \\nwith the operating margin at 25.3% , and net margin \\nat 20% . Our Earnings Per Share was at `103.62 , \\ngrowing 16.1%*   over the prior year. Our cash conversion continues to be very strong, \\nwith a cash conversion ratio of 104.2%  and free \\ncash flow of `36,985 crore . \\nThe Board has recommended a final dividend of \\n`22 for the year, bringing the total dividend for \\nthe year to `43 per share. Additionally, during the \\nyear, we successfully completed our fourth buyback \\nin five years, to the tune of `18,000 crore , \\nrepresenting a total payout of `38,010 crore  \\nincluding buyback tax of `4,192 crore paid out in \\nApril 2022. This amounts to over 102.8%  of the \\nfree cash flow.\\nOur new purpose-designed organization structure, \\nalong with continued investments in building \\nnewer capabilities, next generation delivery models \\nand assets that help our clients innovate at scale, \\nand in building our brand, will help us deepen our \\ncustomer relationships, expand our addressable \\nmarket, gain market share and power growth in the \\nyears ahead.\\nLetter from the\\n1CEO\\n1 GRI 2-22\\n*Excluding provision towards legal claim in prior year.\\nLetter from the CEO  |  9Beyond the headline numbers, we are pleased with \\nthe holistic nature of the growth, broad-based \\nacross all our industry verticals and major markets, \\nand with a steadily expanding number of growth and \\ntransformation engagements in the portfolio. \\nGrowth was led by Retail and Consumer Business \\nwhich was impacted the most during the pandemic \\nand which has bounced back strongly, growing \\n20.0% . Manufacturing grew 16.7% , Banking, \\nFinancial Services and Insurance grew 14.5%  and \\nCommunications, Media and T echnology grew 17.7% . \\nLife Sciences and Healthcare grew 20.6%  and Others \\nwhich makes up 7.8%  of revenues grew 15.5% .\\nAll our major markets grew in the mid-teens or above. \\nNorth America grew 18.7% , Continental Europe \\ngrew 15.2%  and UK grew 18.5% . Among emerging \\nmarkets, Latin America grew 18.6% , India grew 16% , \\nMiddle East & Africa grew 16.3%  while Asia Pacific \\ngrew 6.9% .\\nInnovating for Greater Futures\\nOur outstanding performance this year, and the \\nstrong demand for our services that drove it, can \\nbe traced back to the innovation that enterprises \\nscrambled to adopt at the start of the pandemic, to \\nengage with customers digitally and to improve their \\noperational resilience. \\nThe cloud adoption trends strengthened further in FY \\n2022, with more clients embarking on multi-horizon cloud transformation journeys . However, the mindsets \\nhave changed. During the year, enterprises moved \\nfrom thinking of technology-led innovation as a way \\nof coping with pandemic challenges, to looking at it as \\na means of powering their growth and transformation \\n(G&T), especially in the case of clients who had already \\nmoved their most critical workloads to the cloud.\\nWhile G&T initiatives tend to be business focused and \\ntechnology agnostic, immense possibilities for business \\ntransformation open up once enterprises move some \\nof their workloads to the hyperscaler cloud. This is \\ntriggering a wave of business innovation in the form of \\nHorizon Two or Horizon Three initiatives by our clients.\\nIn FY 2022, we won deals addressing a broad \\ngamut of G&T objectives such as M&A, newer ways \\nof working, product innovation, business model \\ninnovation and innovations around improved customer \\nexperience. We have been providing examples of \\nthese in our recent annual reports, including this \\nyear’s report. \\nA new trend this year was the growing volume of \\nsustainability-related innovation, a good indicator how \\nthis has become a top priority item on most CEO \\nagendas. We have leveraged our deep expertise in \\nIoT, advanced analytics, and machine learning to come \\nup with a suite of offerings in this space, including \\nintellectual property such as Clever Energy™, IP2™ \\nand TCS Envirozone™. Clients across industries such \\nas retail, manufacturing, utilities and consumer goods are engaging us to develop innovative technology-\\nled solutions to reduce energy consumption, or to \\nmeasure and track green-house gas emissions across \\ntheir end-to-end supply chain, reduce their carbon \\nfootprint, reduce waste and promote recycling.\\nWe are very proud of the steadily expanding number \\nof G&T deals in our order book because each such \\nwin represents market share gain for TCS from legacy \\nconsulting organizations which have traditionally \\ndominated this space. It is an outcome of our sustained \\ninvestments in creating enabling capabilities within the \\norganization, be it in cultivating contextual knowledge, \\nor research and innovation, building intellectual \\nproperty, deepening digital expertise, cultivating \\ntechnology partnerships and building our brand. \\nThe growing component of G&T revenue in our \\nportfolio is also evidence that our differentiated, \\ninside-out approach to transformation is resonating \\nwell with our clients. Our collaborative ways, and \\nfocus on harnessing collective contextual knowledge \\nresults in better buy-in for the transformation from \\nstakeholders across the organization, setting it up for \\nsuccess. Our brand statement, `Building on Belief’, has \\nalso found strong resonance in the market, instilling \\nhope into business and trust in the enterprise. \\nAll-time High Order Book\\nAll this is not to say that Horizon One spending, the \\ninvestments that enterprises make at the start of their \\ncloud journeys, while migrating to a new cloud-based \\nLetter from the CEO  |  10digital core, is coming to an end as a key demand \\ndriver. Far from it, we saw strong deal flow right \\nthrough the year from Horizon One initiatives. \\nThe sheer scale, depth of consulting expertise and \\nfull-service capabilities of our dedicated business \\nunits on each of the three large hyperscalers, and the \\ninvestments we have made in building a rich portfolio \\nof accelerators and toolsets for automating application \\nand data estate modernization and cloud migration \\ngive us a distinct edge in this opportunity.\\nClients engaged us for some, or all, of the activities, \\nstarting from cloud assessment, business case \\npreparation, roadmap creation, ERP consolidation \\nand migration, application and data modernization \\nand cloud migration. When core applications are \\nre-engineered using cloud-native architectures, \\nor on-premise ERP is moved to SaaS, it is not just \\na technology transformation but also a business \\ntransformation. \\nSuch cloud transformation engagements are material, \\nmulti-year transformation engagements which when \\ncompleted, result in resilient, future-ready digital \\ntechnology stacks that enable leaner, more agile \\noperations and very importantly, serve as a scalable \\nfoundation for their innovation and growth. \\nPartnering with our clients in this initial phase is \\nimportant not only for the sheer volume of business \\ninvolved, but also because it is a gateway to the \\nunbounded opportunity that the downstream \\ninnovation and transformation represent. The granular contextual knowledge of our clients’ business and \\ntechnology landscapes, gained while executing \\nHorizon One and other ADM programs, are critical \\nfor our ability to proactively pitch innovative ideas and \\nsolutions for their growth and transformation.\\nThe other big demand driver was outsourcing of \\nbusiness and IT operations. There were three key \\nreasons why enterprises outsourced more in FY \\n2022: the need to free up people as well as financial \\nresources to execute their growth and transformation \\ninitiatives; talent scarcity especially in digital \\ntechnologies, made worse by the Great Resignation; \\nand the desire for leaner and more resilient IT and \\nbusiness operations. During the year, we saw many \\ninstances where clients engaged TCS to transform \\ntheir operating models, and then manage those \\noperations on their behalf.\\nHere too, our delivery model innovation, the Machine \\nFirst™ approach, helped us win many large deals and \\ngain share over pure play outsourcing companies. \\nOur transformational approach embeds powerful \\ntechnologies like machine vision, machine learning, \\nand our AI-powered intellectual property such as \\nignio™ and Cognix™ into the core of our clients’ \\nprocesses, transforming the human-machine interface \\nand delivering much leaner, faster and more resilient \\nbusiness and IT operations.\\nThroughout the year, these three trends – increased \\nspend on innovation and transformation, cloud \\nmigration and outsourcing – drove a strong flow of deals of all sizes. The total contract value of deals \\nsigned in the first three quarters averaged between \\n$7-8 billion per quarter, capped by an all-time high \\norder book of $11.3 billion  in the fourth quarter. The \\nrobustness of the deal flow at the close of the year \\nbecomes evident when even after excluding the two \\nmega deals of roughly a billion dollars each won in \\nQ4, the order book TCV in Q4 was $9.5 billion, which \\nis also an all-time high. The full year order book was \\n$34.6 billion , our highest ever, representing a book \\nto bill ratio of 1.3.\\nNew Benchmarks in People Management\\nOur purpose-driven approach to business and \\nour values have shaped TCS’ culture and work \\nenvironment. We believe in investing in our people \\nand giving them opportunities to realize their full \\npotential. We believe in decentralized decision-\\nmaking, in empowering leaders on the front lines, and \\nin providing them all the support they need in their \\njourneys. We also believe in treating the organization \\nas an extended family, and standing by each member \\nin their hour of need.  This was best demonstrated \\nin our response to the brutal second wave of the \\npandemic at the start of FY 2022. We scaled up \\nour employee engagement, provided hospitalization \\nsupport and access to Covid care centers at our \\nfacilities in 13 cities and undertook a massive – \\npossibly the largest of its kind, pan-India vaccination \\ndrive, covering over a million individuals – employees \\nand their dependents.\\nLetter from the CEO  |  11This philosophy, and our progressive policies and work \\nculture have resulted in a very strong employer brand, \\nvalidated by several third-party assessments and \\naccolades during the year. This played an critical role \\nin helping your company cope with the industry-wide \\nsupply side challenges during the year.\\nT o support the strong growth momentum in FY \\n2022, we flexed the strength of that employer brand \\nto set new benchmarks and cross new milestones \\nin attracting and managing talent at scale across the \\nworld. Our workforce crossed the half-million mark in \\nthe first half of the year, and we ended the year with a \\nheadcount of 592,195 , an all-time high net addition \\nof 103,546 employees. \\nThe workforce remains a highly diverse one, with \\nover 153 nationalities  represented. We crossed \\nan important diversity milestone this year, with the \\nnumber of women in the workforce exceeding \\n200,000 . We are also making progress, slowly but \\nsteadily, in improving gender diversity in the senior \\nmanagement ranks. Through focused leadership \\ndevelopment programs, the number of women senior \\nexecutives has grown 84% over the last 5 years, \\nsignificantly higher than the male cohort. \\nOrganic talent development continues to be a key \\nfocus area in our journey to be a G&T partner to \\nmore of our clients. TCSers collectively logged \\n60.3 million  learning hours and acquired over \\n3.5 million  digital competencies in FY 2022. Very \\nimportantly, the number of Contextual Masters in the organization crossed 50,000  this year, 24%  of them \\nwomen.\\nThe year also witnessed a sharp rise in employee \\nturnover across the industry. TCS’ attrition in IT \\nservices (L TM) was  17.4% in FY 2022. Despite the \\nincrease, your company stood out with the lowest \\nattrition in the industry and remained the benchmark \\nfor talent retention.\\nCommunity and planet\\nWe continued to work with communities across the \\nworld, pursuing our long-standing commitment to \\nprograms in the areas of health, STEM education, \\nskills development and the bridging of digital divides. \\nThese programs are scaling well in reach as well as \\ndepth of impact, touching the lives of over 1.7 million \\nbeneficiaries – women, youth and marginalized people. \\nT o maximize the impact of our programs, we are now \\npartnering with our customers in these initiatives. We \\nengaged with 850 business leaders and teams, across \\n146 customer organizations and connected with over \\n50 government leaders on collaborative community \\nefforts. \\nTCSers have also been quick to respond to the \\nhumanitarian tragedy in Ukraine, helping in rescue \\nefforts, relief assistance, resilience support. T o address \\nthe urgent needs of children, women, and those facing \\nfood insecurity, TCS is making a financial contribution \\nof 1 million Euros to international humanitarian organizations like the UNICEF and the European \\nFood Banks Federation which are helping support war \\nrefugees streaming into neighboring countries. We \\nare also matching funds raised by employees, families, \\nand their networks, up to 500,000 Euros, as donation \\nto these two organizations.\\nOn the environment front, we have good progress \\nto report in our journey to become net zero by \\n2030 . Our absolute carbon footprint across Scope \\n1 and Scope 2 emissions reduced by 66%  over base \\nyear 2016 due to focused initiatives around energy \\nefficiency and transition to renewable energy. We \\nmade a big leap on the latter, with use of renewable \\nenergy across TCS’ global operations growing to \\n37.2%  of the total (15.6% in FY 2021).\\nLooking Ahead  \\nOur all-time high order book, continued deal flow and \\npipeline velocity give us confidence in the sustainability \\nof our business momentum. We are in the midst of \\na multi-year technology upgrade cycle that provides \\nstrong, structural growth drivers for the next few \\nyears. \\nThe geo-political tensions in Europe and the resultant \\nimpact on global economic growth are real threats. \\nHowever, the pandemic has shown us that enterprise \\nspending on technology is far more resilient than \\nmost people credit it for. It is central to organizations’ \\nability to innovate and differentiate in good times, \\nand to survive and adapt in tough times. While \\nLetter from the CEO  |  12evolving market dynamics may prompt reprioritizing of \\nprograms, we are confident that technology spending \\nitself will continue to grow. That growth and our \\nexpanding market share give us confidence of being \\nable to sustain a certain base case growth, with room \\nto maximize in better years. \\nAt our current pace of growth, it is only a matter \\nof time before we double our revenues and hit the \\n$50 billion mark. In our journey to that next logical \\nmilestone, we are focused on not only our velocity, \\nbut also on ensuring we get there fighting fit, so it \\ndoes not become a finish line to stumble across, but a \\nlaunchpad to achieve even greater heights. For this to \\nhappen we are focusing on two things. \\nOne, we want to arrive at that milestone with a more \\nbalanced portfolio, with a much larger proportion of \\nbusiness transformation revenues, so we have two \\nequally strong growth engines for the journey ahead. \\nFor this, we want to build on our initial successes in \\nthe G&T opportunity, and put in place a structured \\nway to deepen existing innovation and transformation \\nengagements, while expanding the number of clients \\nfor whom we provide such services.\\nSecond, as we get larger, we shouldn’t lose sight \\nof what has brought us thus far – our customer \\ncentricity. Our success stems from the fact that year \\nafter year, our clients reward us with more work, \\nand rank us #1 in customer satisfaction across all \\nthe service providers they work with. Our approach \\nof putting the client at the center of everything we do, making them feel special, and investing in newer \\ncapabilities to create value in newer areas of their \\nbusinesses, has paid us rich dividends. Regardless \\nof how large we get, we want to make sure that \\nour customer focus never wavers, and every client \\ncontinues to feel just as valued.\\nWe have rolled out a new organization structure that \\nwill help us achieve these two imperatives. It retains \\nthe atomicity of our earlier architecture, and its three \\ndimensions – industry verticals, horizontal service \\nlines and geography-based sales. We have now added \\na fourth dimension, the stage of the customer’s \\nrelationship journey with TCS.\\nThat journey begins when a client first signs up for \\nsome initial work. When we successfully deliver, they \\ngive us more work and that is how the relationship \\nstarts growing. As trust levels steadily go up, they start \\nviewing TCS as a strategic partner and consolidate \\nmore and more of their technology requirements with \\nus. That is how we have steadily grown and deepened \\nrelationships with nearly 60 clients globally who spend \\nmore than $100 million on us annually.\\nWe have rearranged existing units into three business \\ngroups, each aligned to a particular phase in the \\ncustomer relationship journey: the Relationship \\nIncubation Group  that will provide the high-touch, \\nhigh engagement, delivery-focused model that \\nnew clients require; the Enterprise Growth Group  \\nwhich will do what today’s TCS does best, that is, \\npull together capabilities from across the different service lines to stitch together solutions that address \\nour clients’ business needs when the relationship \\nis in its hyper growth phase; and the Business \\nTransformation Group  that will manage our largest \\nclients and help them accomplish their growth and \\ntransformation objectives.\\nAs clients progress in their relationship journeys, the \\naccount ownership will seamlessly transition from \\none group to the next, with all three groups working \\nin synchrony to make sure that every client gets a \\ncurated experience and that we steadily progress \\nevery client relationship to the highest level of \\nmaturity with TCS being their preferred growth and \\ntransformation partner.\\nThis new purpose-designed organization structure, \\nalong with continued investments in building newer \\ncapabilities, next generation delivery models and \\nassets that help our clients innovate at scale, and in \\nbuilding our brand, will help us deepen our customer \\nrelationships, expand our addressable market, gain \\nmarket share and power growth in the years ahead. \\nWe thank you for your continued support in this \\nexciting journey ahead.\\nWarm regards,\\nRajesh Gopinathan\\nChief Executive Officer and Managing Director\\nLetter from the CEO  |  13The Y ear Gone By\\nWon a very large contract from \\na Fortune 100 US company , \\nfurther expanding the long-standing \\npartnership, to transform the \\ntechnology at its global data centers \\ninto a future-ready, hybrid cloud stack for greater \\nagility, flexibility, and improved operational resilience. \\nTCS will also deploy a new cognitive-powered \\noperating model to run that stack, to improve the \\navailability of business applications and enhance user \\nexperience. \\nSelected by Payments Canada , the country’s largest \\npayment organization, to transform its payment \\nsystem operations and help implement the Real-\\nTime Rail (RTR), the new real-time payments system \\nthat will allow Canadians to initiate payments and \\nreceive irrevocable funds in seconds, 24/7/365.

The next trigger \\nwas the adaptation required to compete in many \\ncontexts created by digital business models. Finally, as \\nenterprises are moving into a post-pandemic world \\nof new risks, challenges and opportunities, a more \\nstrategic, purpose driven strategy is driving innovation.\\nThese factors are driving enterprises to develop a wide \\nand deep innovation capability, which can scale. This is \\nnot easy. Most have found it difficult to measure up on \\nboth scale and speed. Smaller competitors may offer \\na non-stop stream of innovations. Large enterprises \\nPanel Discussion  |  35repeatable process which can significantly scale up and \\nspeed up their innovation.\\nA good example of this is the innovation factory \\nwe have set up for Takeda1 . Using cloud, design \\nthinking, and location independent agile methods, \\nour combined teams are taking up innovative ideas \\nacross procurement, logistics and finance, and building \\ninnovative digital assets at twice the velocity. \\nKrishnan:  The three broad themes around which we \\nsaw our clients innovate the most were growth and \\ntransformation (G&T), resilience, and sustainability. We \\nhave been making significant investments in creating \\ncapabilities strategically relevant to each of these \\nthemes, some of which we have described in our prior \\nyears’ annual reports as well.\\nG&T is most often about expanding organically or \\ninorganically into adjacencies, be it of products and \\nservices, or customers and markets, and occasionally, \\nmoonshots. Good examples are our transformational \\nengagements with clients like Swiss Re, Bovemij and \\nRS Components described in our FY 2022 annual \\nreport2, or the work we have done for Bayer, Damen \\nShipyards and T oyo Tires described in prior years’ \\nannual reports. \\nWe have been leveraging our deep contextual \\nknowledge of our clients’ businesses, extensive \\nindustry knowledge and experience, our rich portfolio \\nof intellectual property, digital engineering expertise \\n1 Page 33, 2 Pages 41, 34 and 45 respectivelyAren’t large enterprises also constrained by \\ntheir legacy technology stacks? How do they \\novercome that challenge?and our differentiated inside-out approach to \\ntransformation to help bring their G&T visions to \\nfruition. \\nUnderpinning our work in G&T are our key innovation \\npillars – our Pace Ports™, the TCS Co-innovation \\nNetwork (TCS COIN™), research collaborations with \\nleading academic institutions, `Future of Business’ \\nframeworks, W12 design studios, and our products \\nand platforms like TCS BaNCS™, Optumera™, \\nOptunique™, ADD, ignio™, Bringing Life to Things™, \\nCloudonomy™, and Cognix™ among others.\\nThe second big theme is resilience, which is the \\nability to weather foreseen as well as unforeseen \\nemergencies. In these last two years, many of our \\nlargest deal wins were around transforming clients’ IT \\nand business operating models, and their supply chain \\nmanagement processes, using ignio or TCS Cognix to \\nembed intelligent automation for greater resilience \\nand agility. Much of the rush to embrace the cloud in \\nthe early months of the pandemic was also driven by \\nthis need. \\nLastly, we saw clients focus heavily on sustainability \\nin FY 2022, particularly around carbon footprint \\nreduction. Our investments in innovative digital \\nsolutions such as Envirozone™, Clever EnergyTM and \\nIP2™, and our expertise in cloud, data and analytics, \\nAI and ML are helping us win more and more of such \\nengagements, helping us amplify our contribution \\nto the worldwide collective effort to mitigate climate \\nchange and build greater futures.NGS:  I call them heritage. They have been around \\nand doing a good job of running their businesses in a \\nway that encapsulates their organization’s processes, \\nchecks and balances. Most organizations have worked \\nto build APIs or middleware that enable their digital \\nstrategies, though they are suboptimal.\\nWhat we have observed is that as soon as enterprises \\nsimplify their IT landscapes and build a new, cloud-\\nbased digital core, supporting micro services in a cloud \\nnative environment, their ability to realize innovative \\nideas and deploy them in production shoots up. They \\nare able to anchor or participate in ecosystems at will, \\nwhich drives growth and innovation.What we have observed is that as \\nsoon as enterprises simplify their IT \\nlandscapes and build a new, cloud-based \\ndigital core, supporting micro services in \\na cloud native environment, their ability \\nto realize innovative ideas and deploy \\nthem in production shoots up. \\nPanel Discussion  |  36Y ou may recall the scalable, customer-centric digital \\noperating model we built for the Phoenix Group, using \\nTCS BaNCS3 . Our platform is extensible, supporting the \\nrequired APIs and microservices for them to leverage \\nfintechs and our TCS COIN partners to enable the \\ndifferentiation in the front. \\nKrishnan:  We see this same dynamic with the broader \\nset of clients who undertake Horizon One cloud \\ntransformations. Besides enhanced ability to integrate \\ninnovative new solutions into the core, their appetite for \\ninnovation itself goes up. The richness of the technology \\ncapabilities built into today’s hyperscaler clouds triggers \\nmore innovative thinking and the desire to experiment \\nwith those powerful technologies to reimagine different \\naspects of the business. \\nAnother challenge that large enterprises face is the need \\nto invest for the longer-term growth of their businesses, \\nwithout disrupting near-term financials. TCS helps them \\nsquare this circle by providing a line of sight for funding \\nthe innovation pipeline or the transformation by helping \\noptimize operations. \\nWe work closely with the client to reimagine parts of \\ntheir IT and business operations, or perhaps their IT \\ninfrastructure, using our Machine First™ approach. The \\nresultant operating models are leaner, more agile and \\nmore responsive. This frees up inhouse talent to take \\nup the more exciting innovation and transformation \\ninitiatives. One large US client of ours for whom we are \\nbuilding a new, cloud-native digital platform to support \\ntheir business forays into adjacencies, calls it their `save \\nto invest’ strategy. How do you see clients’ transition from \\nHorizon One to Horizon T wo spending affect \\nyour growth? Will there be a slump and \\nsubsequent recovery?\\nKrishnan:  The term multi-horizon may suggest clearly \\ndelineated, sequential phases but in reality, clients don’t \\nwait to complete Horizon One, that is, migration of all \\ntheir workloads to the cloud before commencing their \\nHorizon Two initiatives. These progress concurrently. \\nEven as existing workloads are migrated to the cloud, \\nnewer cloud-native systems are built to enhance \\ncustomer experience or to drive product or business \\nmodel innovation. That is how we have been able to give \\nexamples of G&T engagements being executed as part \\nof Horizon Two investments in our quarterly earnings \\ncalls, even though we are still in the middle of the \\nHorizon One opportunity. \\nWe expect the transition to be a seamless one. Horizon \\nOne is a bounded opportunity and will plateau at some \\npoint when most of the workloads are migrated. By \\nthat time, the other two horizons, which are boundless \\nopportunities would have scaled up and will support \\nour future growth. All our investments into building \\nour G&T capabilities, our branding and the new \\norganization structure are geared to help us maximize \\nour participation at that point.NGS:  Our order book has had a good mix of small \\nand medium projects, as well as large outsourcing and \\ntransformation deals in FY 2022. This mix is important \\nfor our short and long term business growth. Projects \\nare increasingly executed using Agile methods. The \\nfocus here is to deliver 'speed to value' by structuring the \\nprogram over multiple monthly sprints. Here clients are \\nmore comfortable structuring the contracts with short \\ntenures. The rise in the number of short tenure deals is \\nlinked to the growing share of such work in our order \\nbook.\\nOn the outsourcing front too, average deal tenures \\nhave come down on the heritage stacks.

Given the desire to get this transformation \\ndone rapidly, they are outsourcing the run and change \\nof the existing portfolio for relatively shorter tenures \\nand hence lower TCVs. \\nKrishnan:  The impression about smaller companies \\ngrowing faster is more due to sampling bias, based on \\na handful of highly visible outperformers. That is not \\ntrue if you look at the global cohort. Even though the \\nbottom quartile by revenue size had its best growth \\nin a decade in 2021, it still underperformed the top \\nquartile by a significant margin. \\nOverall, the current demand environment is a rising \\ntide that has lifted all boats. Horizon One is a very \\ndemocratic opportunity, largely technology-centric. \\nHaving enough people with the requisite certifications \\nand skills is sufficient to participate in this opportunity. \\nThe severe talent scarcity is also driving a broad The large scale vendor consolidation \\nanticipated two years ago doesn’t seem to \\nhave materialized. How come?\\nKrishnan:  Vendor consolidation is typically done to \\nfind an alternative strategic provider with a richer set \\nof capabilities and a superior execution track record. \\nHowever, the sharp recovery and subsequent growth \\nin demand, coinciding with the great resignation and \\ntalent scarcity, have resulted in enterprises focusing \\nmore on pursuing their immediate technology \\npriorities.\\nThat said, we still won several large deals during the \\nyear where we displaced incumbents. If you look at \\nthe global market, the industry grew 6% whereas all \\nthe top tier players grew double digits, indicating that \\nthe longer-term consolidation trends are very much \\nintact. The industry didn’t see too many billion-\\ndollar deals in FY 2022. How important are \\nthey for longer-term growth? \\nNGS:  All deals are important to us. Billion-dollar deals \\nare especially important because they boost medium-\\nterm visibility and provide us opportunities to bring the \\nwhole of TCS’ offerings to play. We are very pleased \\nat winning two such deals during the year. Having \\nsaid that, the perceived importance of such deals for \\nlonger term growth need not be exaggerated versus  \\nsmaller deals of say, $100million+ TCV. \\nFor sustained longer term growth, what matters is \\nthat the base order book size, excluding the occasional \\nmega deal, keeps growing year after year, and that \\nthe quality of revenue keeps improving with higher \\nvalue engagements. Our average order book size \\nwhich used to be in the $6-7 billion range in FY \\n2021 moved to the $7-8 billion range in FY 2022, \\nand ended with an all-time high order book of \\n$11.3 billion in Q4.

How will the tensions in Europe, rising \\ninflation and the looming threat of a \\nrecession affect spending on innovation, on \\ntechnology and on your growth outlook?\\nAnanth:  Let me address the innovation part. It is \\na misconception that innovation is a nice-to-have \\nactivity apt for only good times. In fact, it is essential at \\nall times, good or bad. In good times, enterprises \\nPanel Discussion  |  38may fund more product innovation or customer \\nexperience transformation, targeting business growth \\nor increased customer intimacy. \\nIn tough times, they find new ways of working to \\nboost their resilience and adaptability – for example, \\nre-designing the value chain at a strategic level. \\nThe sheer volume of innovation we saw over the \\nlast two years, even in the face of bleak business \\noutlook, is testament to that. We designed and rolled \\nout AI-powered digitized underwriting and claims \\nprocessing for insurers, omnichannel experiences with \\nin-aisle checkouts for retailers, or remote monitoring \\nand pre-emptive maintenance of equipment for \\nmanufacturers and utilities. None of these are `nice to \\nhave’ capabilities. These were necessary to simply stay \\nin business, to stay relevant in the face of changing \\nconsumer behavior, and to cope with the operational \\nchallenges posed by the pandemic. So even in an economic slowdown, innovation doesn’t \\nstop. They may reprioritize one program over another \\nbased on shifting objectives, but the spending will \\ncontinue. Partnering with TCS to innovate at scale will \\nenable them to try out more ideas, and experiment \\nmore extensively with the same budget, and improve \\nthe yield on their innovation investment.\\nNGS:  We have been through multiple disruptive \\nmacroeconomic events in the last decade and a \\nhalf – the GFC, taper tantrums, Eurozone crisis, \\nBrexit, the pandemic and now the war and the \\nresulting humanitarian crisis. We always take a view \\nthat business is about growing in a constrained \\nenvironment and over these events, we have survived, \\ncontinued to grow and have ensured that we stay \\nahead of the technology curve. This speaks to the \\nresilience of our business model, and of the essential \\nnature of the services we offer to businesses across \\nthe world.\\nT oday, technology is central to any enterprise. \\nBusinesses are rooted in technology, to the \\nextent that every company is aspiring to become \\na technology company. Insurers are launching \\ntechnology platforms for their ecosystem partners, \\nand generating new revenue streams from that. The \\nworld’s largest banks are incubating fintechs within the \\nenterprise, and betting on those to drive their future \\ngrowth. Retailers are depending heavily on online \\nsales. These are all recent structural changes. Partnering with TCS to innovate \\nat scale will enable them to try out \\nmore ideas, and experiment more \\nextensively with the same budget, \\nand improve the yield on their \\ninnovation investment.So conventional wisdom on technology spending, \\nbased on historic behaviors during prior slowdowns, \\nmay not be as reliable. In the post-pandemic world, \\nwe expect technology spending to hold up well even \\nin a downturn. \\nWe can’t predict the future, but based simply on the \\ndeal signing momentum, our pipeline, and our on the \\nground observations of clients planning multi-horizon \\ninvestments for their growth and transformation, \\nwe remain confident that we are on a good growth \\ntrajectory for the next three to five years.\\nPanel Discussion  |  39Transforming Israel’s Banking Sector\\nThe Government of Israel’s Ministry of Finance was \\nlooking to encourage the entry of new digital-only \\nbanks that would boost competition, spark greater \\ninnovation and rejuvenate the banking sector.

In our industry, it wasn’t \\nas much due to the Great Resignation, as a churn \\nwithin the industry. Peers who had not anticipated \\nthe sharp demand recovery scrambled to fulfill it \\nby poaching at scale from other companies. That \\ntriggered a cycle of hiring and counter-hiring of each \\nother’s employees, sending attrition rates shooting \\nacross the industry. \\nOur attrition went up as well. But our commitment \\nto people, investing in them and empowering them \\nto realize their potential, along with closer employee \\nengagement, have helped us remain a benchmark \\nin talent retention. We also expanded our hiring \\nprogram, flexing the strength of our employer brand \\nto attract experienced and fresh talent at scale. We \\nundertook several other tactical measures to cope \\nwith the supply side challenges, including generous \\npromotions, retention bonuses and increased use of \\nsub-contractors. More importantly, we addressed the structural \\nproblem of industry-wide talent scarcity by training \\nand onboarding 118,000 fresh engineers in FY 2022. \\nThis massive infusion of fresh talent by us, as well as by \\nothers in the industry, should start easing the problem \\nin FY 2023. There are some early signs of this. Our \\nattrition is plateauing on a quarterly annualized basis. \\nL TM attrition will likely rise further in the first half of \\nFY 2023 and after that, it should start tapering.How did you cope with supplyside \\nchallenges due to the Great Resignation \\nthis year? Is the worst behind us?Milind:  There are two reasons. One, there was \\nsignificant offshore shift during the pandemic due to \\ngreater acceptance of remote working, local talent \\nscarcity, and the flow of work to where the talent \\nresides. That was deflationary in nature. Second, \\nwe have been hiring additional numbers ahead \\nof demand, in anticipation of continued growth \\nmomentum and to have a ready bench to back-fill \\nattrition.\\nOver the last 3 years, your net addition \\nhas significantly outstripped your revenue \\ngrowth.

Operating \\nleverage, improved realizations and some currency \\nsupport helped us mitigate to the extent of 270 bps, \\nresulting in an industry-leading operating margin of \\n25.3%. \\nLooking ahead, I expect the supplyside headwinds \\nto persist for most of the year. Additionally, as things \\nnormalize, travel and facilities expenses should also \\ninch up. That will be mitigated by the full year benefit \\nof large numbers of fresh engineers onboarded in \\nFY 2022, leverage from continued revenue growth, \\nimproved realizations and hopefully, some currency \\nsupport. Overall, we want to keep our margins stable in \\nthe medium term.\\nSamir:  We don’t provide revenue or margin \\nguidance. However, 26-28% remains our longer term \\naspirational band for the operating margin. Setting \\naside short term headwinds, we don’t see any change \\nto our longer term cost structures or our relative \\ncompetitiveness. Just five quarters ago, we were in \\nthat band, so there is no reason why we can’t get \\nthere again.Samir:  We don’t think so. We truly believe that \\nit is possible to pursue profitable growth without \\ncompromising on either. The data bears us out. We \\nhave kept our margins in the same tight band for over a \\ndecade now. During this period, we have outgrown our \\nlargest and far more acquisitive local and global peers, \\nand delivered better margins..\\nThe underlying premise of the question is that with \\nsimilar costs, higher margins must mean higher prices \\nversus competition, and therefore lower sales. The flaw \\nlies in that assumption on costs. While raw costs may be \\nsimilar, our cost of delivery is lower because of higher \\nlevel of industrialization in our delivery model, better \\ntraining and better employer practices, resulting in better \\nretention. So we are able to compete very effectively, \\nand are winning all time high order books without \\ncompromising on profitability.\\nLet me also explain briefly how we manage margins \\non the ground.

Our policy of grooming \\nand promoting leadership from within, personalized \\nassessments, leadership development programs, \\npromotions and the collective efforts of the entire \\nleadership team have helped us grow the  number of \\nwomen in that cohort by 84% over the last five years.\\nWith continued push and with new leadership positions \\nopening up faster, and in larger numbers because \\nof the high growth environment we are in, we are \\nconfident that we will make more progress over the \\nnext five years, than we did in the last five. But there \\nare no shortcuts to this.\\nRitu:  Y es, we could. Hiring only women senior \\nmanagers from outside for all new leadership rolesWhy not? Y ou could just announce a target \\nto have 50% women in senior management \\nand hire accordingly?One of the biggest contributors to our \\nindustry-leading talent retention is our \\nlong-standing policy of preferring internal \\ncandidates for new leadership positions.

This may take time to show on the outside, but it \\nis fairer to our employees and more sustainable in the long \\nrun.   \\nAs you look at doubling your revenue, what will \\nTCS’ workforce look like? Will you have a million \\nemployees?\\nMilind: We believe our workforce will be more diverse, \\ndemographically and geographically. With a larger \\nbusiness transformation component in our revenue mix, \\nI expect that we will also have more diverse capabilities \\nwithin the workforce – more researchers and innovators, \\nmore business consultants across industry verticals and \\ntechnology horizontals, more product and IP owners, more \\nsolution architects, and more specialists in softer areas like \\nempathetic design and organizational change management. \\nIt is harder to predict how the headcount will grow. With a \\nlarger component of G&T revenues with higher realizations, \\nIP-linked revenues and the mainstreaming of technologies \\nlike low code/no code which are less effort intensive, we \\nshould be able to double revenues without needing a \\nmillion employees. But even if it comes to that, we are no \\nlonger intimidated by large numbers. Our model has proved \\nits scalability, and we are confident we will continue to \\nremain a benchmark in talent management.would certainly give us an opportunity to trumpet \\nour leadership in gender diversity. But I see this as \\nunsustainable.\\nWomen’s overall participation in the labor force here \\nis under 20%, perhaps 15% if you take the urban \\nworkforce. The percentage at senior management levels \\nis much smaller, and the available hiring pool is a fraction \\nof that. Given this lack of availability at an industry level, \\ncompanies would simply end up hiring and re-hiring \\neach others' senior executives, driving up industry-level \\nexecutive churn.\\nInstead, the industry should address this at a systemic \\nlevel, and collectively do more of what we are currently \\ndoing at TCS. Run school-level programs to encourage \\ngirls to pursue STEM education and careers, support \\nmentoring programs, provide opportunities to women \\nreturning after career breaks, invest in leadership \\ndevelopment and increase the number of women at all \\nlevels. That will expand the industry’s female leadership \\npool and give everyone an opportunity to avail the \\nbenefits of diversity.\\nMilind: Also, parachuting external candidates into \\nleadership positions just to achieve a diversity quota \\nQ&A  |  44Helping RS Components Deepen Customer Relationships and Drive Profitable Growth\\n      \\nPartnering with TCS in launching RS \\nIndustria brought a number of strengths to \\nus – their IIoT expertise, their knowledge \\naround remote diagnostics and predictive \\nservices, their understanding of the Amazon \\nWeb platform and how to build really \\nadvanced solutions in that space and lastly \\ntheir collaborative way of working.

TCS’ customer-centric worldview helps spot trends early, embrace business opportunities by making the right investments and mitigating risks while discharging its social and environmental responsibilities.\\nTCS has been broadening and deepening customer \\nrelationships by continually looking for new opportunities and newer areas in their businesses to add value, proactively investing in building newer capabilities, reskilling its workforce and launching newer services, solutions, products and platforms to address those opportunities.\\nIn the last few years, the company has been using \\nits investments in research and innovation, its intellectual property and deep contextual knowledge of the customer’s business and technology landscape \\nto proactively pitch ideas and solutions designed \\nto improve the client’s topline and help drive \\ncompetitive differentiation.\\nThese growth and transformation (G&T) \\nengagements are higher value engagements catering \\n3 GRI 2-22to the needs of a broader set of stakeholders in the client organization, and is helping drive a steady \\nincrease in the scope and scale of services consumed \\nyear after year, and expand TCS’ share of wallet, as evidenced by the client metrics.\\nAt an aggregate level, this strategy has resulted in \\ndeep and enduring customer relationships, a vibrant and engaged workforce, industry-leading profitability, \\na steady expansion of the addressable market, and \\na proven track record in delivering longer term stakeholder value.\\nEnabling InvestmentsTCS pioneered\\n4 the use of the word ‘digital’ to \\ndescribe the new family of technologies that \\nemerged in the last decade. Quick to recognize the \\npotential of cloud, the company made investments \\nahead of time in launching new platform-based business models as far back as in 2009\\n5, reskilling \\nthe workforce, research and innovation, building collaborative workspaces and innovation centers, \\nintellectual property, and alliances and partnerships. \\nThose early investments have given TCS a head start in participating in its customers’ G&T journeys.\\nOver the last 3 years, TCS has been investing in a \\nnetwork of Pace Ports, co-innovation hubs in all \\nits major markets, to provide a physical space for \\n4 Ref AR FY 2012, MD&A, Pages 25, 29 \\n5 Ref AR FY 2010, Letter from CEO, Page 7 Integrated Annual Report 2021-22Management Discussion and Analysis  |  109TCS teams to engage with clients in ideation, rapid \\nprototyping and agile development of innovative ideas. These hubs also house researchers and members of TCS’ extended innovation ecosystem of start-ups and academia. Adding to the Pace Ports in T okyo, New Y ork, Pittsburgh and T oronto, the company inaugurated the Pace Port at Amsterdam in May 2021, and a Digital Garage in Sydney in February 2022.\\nTCS continued to invest in intellectual property, \\nlaunching new variants within the ignio™ suite and building newer functionality and features in the TCS BaNCS™ suite, the Algo Retail suite, the TCS ADD suite, HOBS, TwinX, MasterCraft and Jile. Across each of the industry verticals, the relevant business units launched new service offerings and solutions, catering to the evolving needs of the market – such as the ESG Integration solution suite on all three hyperscaler platforms covering EU taxonomy, Sustainable IT, Green Mortgage, Carbon Bank and Cal-C (Carbon Calculator).\\nThe company launched Cyber Defense Suite – a \\ncomprehensive s uite of modular, quickly adoptable \\ncyber security services on a single platform – to \\nprovide enterprises with a unified 360-degree \\nvisibility and predictive intelligence to proactively defend and respond against evolving risks.\\nTCS’ dedicated practice units around AWS, \\nMicrosoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform, launched in FY 2021, offer customers the full range of transformational and operational services on the respective hyperscaler stacks, spanning advisory services, migration, application and data modernization, including SaaS and enterprise productivity suites, infrastructure, cyber-security and edge.\\nThese units have been steadily investing in training, \\ncertifications, credentials and in building solutions and intellectual property on their respective hyperscaler stacks. In FY 2022, TCS added TCS Omnistore, TCS MasterCraft, 5G Edge Suite, TwinX and its suite of sustainability solutions – namely TCS Clever Energy, TCS IP2 and TCS Envirozone – to the list of its software products and solutions available on the various hyperscaler platforms. TCS also launched Google Cloud Garages for co-innovation leveraging analytics and AI on the cloud, at its Pace Ports in Amsterdam, New Y ork and T okyo.\\nNew Organization Structure\\nTCS rolled out a new, industry-first organization \\nstructure at the end of FY 2022 that further enhances the company’s customer centricity. The new model recognizes that customers’ needs vary and evolve over time as they progress in their relationship journey with TCS, and enables the delivery of a curated experience best suited for each customer’s current stage in that journey. It does this by adding a fourth dimension – i.e. customer relationship stage – to the existing three dimensions of TCS’ organization structure: geography, industry vertical and service line.\\nCustomer acquisition will continue to be done by \\nlocal sales teams in the various markets. Existing customers in major markets will continue to be serviced by the same client partners, but the governance layer on top has been realigned. Instead of being governed as vertical-wise business groups, customers have now been segmented by relationship stage, and vested with three business groups:\\n\\uf09f\\tRelationship Incubation Group to manage \\nnew relationships which require a higher level \\nof hand holding and a differentiated, high touch delivery;\\n\\uf09f\\tEnterprise Growth Group to manage relationships which are in the high growth phase;\\n\\uf09f\\tBusiness Transformation Group to manage large and mature relationships.\\nThe company’s primary reporting segments will continue to be industry verticals and geographic markets. Existing verticalized governance structures, the Industry Solution Units (ISUs) and sub-ISUs, will see their portfolios realigned and rationalized \\nunder these three business groups. Cust omers in \\nemerging markets will continue to be serviced by local country-based organizations.Integrated Annual Report 2021-22Management Discussion and Analysis  |  110The sharper customer focus enabled by the new structure and the resultant curated customer experiences are expected to enhance customer intimacy, facilitate cross-\\nselling and up-selling, expand share of wallet and prepare the company for the journey ahead.\\nStrategic Responses to Opportunities and Threats\\nOpportunity / Threat TCS Approach Outcomes\\nGreater interest in using technology to drive \\nbusiness growth•\\t\\t Focused on developing contextual knowledge and \\napplying that for inside-out transformations.\\n•\\t\\t Continued investments in research and innovation, \\nTCS Pace Ports, and intellectual property.\\n•\\t\\t Dedicated practice with domain experts to bring together TCS’ differentiated capabilities from across the organization to stitch together comprehensive \\nsolutions.\\n•\\t\\t Proactive pitching of solutions to customers’ most \\npressing business problems.\\n•\\t\\t New brand tagline ‘Building on Belief’ to strengthen positioning as a growth and transformation partner.•\\t\\t Expansion of addressable market.\\n•\\t\\t Growing share of G&T business adding to growth.\\n•\\t\\t Higher quality revenue, lending margin resilience.\\n•\\t\\t More deeply embedded in the clients’ business.\\n•\\t\\t Engaging with a broader set of buyers in the client organization.\\n•\\t\\t Higher visibility within C-Suites.\\nAccelerated adoption of public cloud •\\t\\t Launched dedicated business units with end to end capabilities on each of the hyperscaler platforms.\\n•\\t\\t Continued investment by each of these units in skills, certifications, credentials, IP and accelerators.\\n•\\t\\t Articulated the multi-horizon cloud transformation \\nframework.\\n•\\t\\t Made available TCS products and solutions on public \\nclouds.•\\t\\t Strong growth in cloud transformation revenues.\\n•\\t\\t T op tier partner to each of the hyperscalers.\\n•\\t\\t Preferred partner to clients seeking to use cloud native capabilities to power their growth and transformation.Integrated Annual Report 2021-22Management Discussion and Analysis  |  111Opportunity / Threat TCS Approach Outcomes\\nGreater acceptance of as-a-Service platforms •\\t\\t Strengthened alliances and launched new offerings \\naround the popular and new SaaS products.\\n•\\t\\t Helped ISV* clients upgrade their products to launch \\nnew SaaS versions.\\n•\\t\\t Partnering with product manufacturers to help launch innovative as-a-Service offerings using TCS Bring Things to Life IoT framework.\\nTCS IP:\\n•\\t\\t Launched SaaS versions of in-house product \\nportfolio; made available on hyperscaler platforms.\\n•\\t\\t Used IP portfolio to launch new platforms that bundle IP and shared services on the cloud.•\\t\\t Stronger win-win partnerships.\\n•\\t\\t Expansion of addressable market.\\n•\\t\\t Strong growth in SaaS sales.\\n•\\t\\t Platforms drive stickier relationships, with long term \\nrevenue visibility.\\nOperations optimization to fund transformation •\\t\\t Launched the Machine First™ Delivery Model, \\nembedding automation deep within the enterprise to drive greater efficiencies.\\n•\\t\\t Launched the TCS Cognix™ hyper-automation  suite with pre-built solutions for business and  IT operations transformation.•\\t\\t Operations transformation order book of over $1Bn from Cognix since its launch.\\n•\\t\\t Reputation as a partner who helps structure self-funding business transformation programs.\\nPandemic-forced remote working •\\t\\t Launched the Secure Borderless Workspaces™ \\noperating model.\\n•\\t\\t Announced Vision 25x25, heralding a new hybrid \\nworking model for the longer term.\\n•\\t\\t Implemented ‘talent clouds’, staffing projects using  AI to match skills, regardless of location.•\\t\\t Ensured business continuity on mission-critical \\nactivities.\\n•\\t\\t Faster ramp-up of new projects.\\n•\\t\\t More opportunities for employees, based on skills \\nrather than their location.\\n•\\t\\t More flexible working arrangement, that is more gender inclusive.\\n* Independent Software VendorIntegrated Annual Report 2021-22Management Discussion and Analysis  |  112Talent Management\\nTCS aims to attract, develop, motivate and retain \\ndiverse talent, that is critical for its continued success. \\nThe company’s talent management strategy seeks \\nto maximize the potential of every employee by creating a purpose-driven, inclusive, stimulating, and rewarding work environment, delivering outstanding \\nemployee experience, while fueling business growth.\\nIn FY 2022, TCS made the highest ever net addition \\nof 103,546 employees globally, taking the total employee base to 592,195, with 153 nationalities.

The new goal is after having achieved \\nthe previous target of reducing its specific carbon footprint by half by 2020 (versus \\nbaseline year FY 2008), ahead of schedule.\\n  N G Subramaniam, COO & Executive Director, TCS32: “Our net zero goal underlines \\nour renewed commitment to environmental stewardship. T o curb emissions and \\nlimit global warming to well below 2, preferably to 1.5 degrees Celsius, compared to \\npre-industrial levels, all organizations will have to reimagine existing business models \\nand aim for sustainable growth. We are in a unique position to combine our purpose-\\ndriven world view with digital innovation to not only drive our own sustainability, but \\nalso partner with customers, civil society and governments to lead and shape solutions \\nfor a sustainable future,” \\n  At the core of TCS’ strategy to reduce its carbon footprint is improved energy \\nefficiency through the addition of more green buildings to the company’s real estate \\nportfolio, reduction of IT system power usage, and the use of TCS Clever Energy™, \\nwhich leverages IoT, machine learning and AI to optimize energy consumption across \\ncampuses. TCS’ Vision 25x25 is a strategic lever that delinks TCS’ business growth \\nfrom campus expansion, and brings down emissions related to employee commutes \\nand business travel.

Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas \\nemission? If Y es, then provide details75.\\n Y es. TCS has taken up the target to reduce its absolute Scope 1 and Scope 2 \\ncarbon footprint by 70% by 2025 and become net zero by 2030. T o achieve \\nthese targets, the green-house gas management approach has four key \\nlevers – green infrastructure, green IT, IT-enabled operational efficiencies, \\nand renewable energy. These energy efficiency initiatives have resulted in \\navoidance of GHG emissions of approximately 3,200 tCO2e in FY 2022.\\n Green Infrastructure and IT enabled operational efficiency:\\n All new campuses owned by TCS are designed according to green building \\nstandards for energy and resource efficiency. They have roof top solar \\nphotovoltaic installations to reduce the carbon footprint. Currently, 34 TCS \\noffices spanning across over 28.2 million sq. ft of office area, are certified \\ngreen buildings by Indian Green Building Council (IGBC). These make up over \\n64.4% of TCS’ total real estate portfolio in India.\\n In FY 2022, projects were taken up to improve the energy efficiency in \\nexisting buildings as well through retrofits. Cooling systems were upgrade to \\nefficient energy star rated appliances. UPS resizing and consolidation. Modular \\nUPS were adopted where feasible. Other auxiliaries like pumps, cooling towers, \\netc. were also replaced. TCS’ resource optimization center continues to help \\nmonitor the energy use on real time basis to optimize it further by leveraging \\nAI and ML.\\n Green IT:\\n Green IT initiatives include a) IT Energy optimization in Data center and \\nEquipment rooms and b) IT energy optimization in the delivery centers. Data \\ncenter and Equipment room efficiency projects included replacement of over \\n75 GRI 305-5Integrated Annual Report 2021-22Business Responsibility & Sustainability Report  |  22020 UPSs and 30 cooling units with more efficiency systems. The company \\nachieved PUE of 1.65 at the two owned-premise TCS data centers at Y antra \\nPark and Siruseri. Looking forward, the company is incorporating next-gen \\ngreen data center practices with futuristic and modular technologies like \\nModular UPS, Cold Aisle Containment, real time monitoring of temperature \\nand energy consumption, etc . For IT energy optimization in the delivery \\ncenter, the energy efficiency initiatives are through switching off/replacement \\nof excess capacity/inefficient UPSs, replacement of desktops with laptops  and \\nimproved rack per user ratio.\\n Renewable Energy \\n The company continued to augment the roof top solar photo voltaic \\ninstallations this year as well taking the total installed capacity to 10.2 MWp \\ncontributing to 3.76 percent of total electricity use in the reporting year. \\nSolar roof top installations at Adibatla Hyderabad (2,154 kWp) and TCS \\nCenter Kochi (207 kWp) was completed within the reporting year. The \\ncompany increased the renewable energy procurement through third party \\nPPA for solar energy at TCS Siruseri office and switch over to green tariff \\nfor its operations in the states of Karnataka and Maharashtra. This resulted \\nin an increase in the renewable energy use to 37.2% of the company’s total \\nenergy use in FY 2022. TCS is committed to improve the RE mix in its energy \\nportfolio further in the coming years.\\n Carbon Neutrality:\\n The company has become carbon neutral across Scope 1 and Scope 2 carbon \\nfootprint for its operations in Asia Pacific (APAC)76 , Europe and North \\nAmerica (NA) for FY 2022 in line with PAS 2060:2014 standards assured by \\nBureau Veritas India Limited. \\n76 Excluding Japan8.

We:\\n  •  assessed that the estimates of costs to complete were reviewed and approved by appropriate designated management personnel;\\n  •  performed a retrospective analysis of costs incurred with estimated costs to identify significant variations and challenged whether those variations are required to be considered in estimating the remaining costs to complete the contract; \\n  •  assessed the appropriateness of work in progress (contract assets) on balance sheet date by evaluating the underlying documentation to identify possible changes in estimated costs to complete the remaining performance obligations; and\\n  •  inspected underlying documents and performed analytics to determine reasonableness of contract costs.Integrated Annual Report 2021-22Consolidated Financial Statements  |  235\\nOther Information\\nThe Holding Company’s management and Board of \\nDirectors are responsible for the other information. \\nThe other information comprises the information included in the Holding Company’s Annual Report, but does not include the financial statements and our \\nauditor’s report thereon.

We also:\\n• Identify and assess the risks of material \\nmisstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive \\nto those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is \\nsufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may \\ninvolve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, \\nmisrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\\n• Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under Section 143(3)(i) of the \\nAct, we are also responsible for expressing \\nour opinion on the internal financial controls with reference to the consolidated financial statements and the operating effectiveness of \\nsuch controls.\\n• Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting \\npolicies used and the reasonableness of \\naccounting estimates and related disclosures \\nmade by Management and Board of Directors.\\n• Conclude on the appropriateness of \\nManagement and Board of Directors use of the \\ngoing concern basis of accounting in preparation of consolidated financial statements and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events \\nor conditions that may cast significant doubt \\non the appropriateness of this assumption. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures \\nin the consolidated financial statements or, \\nif such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.\\n• Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the \\nconsolidated financial statements represent the \\nunderlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\\n• Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of entities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements.

Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for goods and services. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction \\nbetween market participants at the measurement date. All assets and liabilities \\nhave been classified as current and non-current as per the Group’s normal \\noperating cycle. Based on the nature of services rendered to customers and \\ntime elapsed between deployment of resources and the realisation in cash and \\ncash equivalents of the consideration for such services rendered, the Group has considered an operating cycle of 12 months.\\n The statement of cash flows have been prepared under indirect method, whereby profit or loss is adjusted for the effects of transactions of a non-cash \\nnature, any deferrals or accruals of past or future operating cash receipts \\nor payments and items of income or expense associated with investing or financing cash flows. The cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities of the Group are segregated. The Group considers all highly liquid \\ninvestments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and are \\nsubject to an insignificant risk of changes in value to be cash equivalents.\\n The functional currency of the Company and its Indian subsidiaries is the Indian Rupee (`). The functional currency of foreign subsidiaries is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates. \\nForeign currency transactions are recorded at exchange rates prevailing \\non the date of the transaction. Foreign currency denominated monetary \\nassets and liabilities are retranslated at the exchange rate prevailing on the \\nbalance sheet dates and exchange gains and losses arising on settlement and restatement are recognised in the statement of profit and loss. Non-monetary \\nassets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in foreign \\ncurrencies are not retranslated.\\n The significant accounting policies used in preparation of the consolidated \\nfinancial statements have been discussed in the respective notes.Integrated Annual Report 2021-22Consolidated Financial Statements  |  253\\nNotes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements4) Basis of consolidation\\n The Company consolidates all entities which are controlled by it.\\n The Company establishes control when; it has power over the entity, is \\nexposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect the entity’s returns by using its power over relevant activities of the entity.\\n Entities controlled by the Company are consolidated from the date control \\ncommences until the date control ceases.\\n The results of subsidiaries acquired, or sold, during the year are consolidated from the effective date of acquisition and up to the effective date of disposal, \\nas appropriate.\\n The financial statements of the Group companies are consolidated on a line-by-line basis and all inter-company transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated in full on consolidation.\\n Changes in the Company’s interests in subsidiaries that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions. The carrying amount of \\nthe Company’s interests and the non-controlling interests are adjusted to \\nreflect the changes in their relative interests in the subsidiaries. Any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognised directly in \\nequity and attributed to shareholders of the Company.\\n Assets and liabilities of entities with functional currency other than the \\nfunctional currency of the Company have been translated using exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Statement of profit and loss of such entities has been translated using weighted average exchange rates. \\nTranslation adjustments have been reported as foreign currency translation reserve in the statement of changes in equity. When a foreign operation is \\ndisposed off in its entirety or partially such that control, significant influence or \\njoint control is lost, the cumulative amount of exchange differences related to \\nthat foreign operation recognised in OCI is reclassified to statement of profit and loss as part of the gain or loss on disposal.\\n5) Use of estimates and judgements\\n The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with the recognition and measurement principles of Ind AS requires management to make estimates and judgements that affect the reported balances of assets \\nand liabilities, disclosures of contingent liabilities as at the date of consolidated \\nfinancial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses for the periods presented.\\n Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the \\nestimates are revised and future periods are affected.\\n The Group uses the following critical accounting estimates in preparation of its consolidated financial statements:\\n(a) Revenue recognition\\n Revenue for fixed-price contracts is recognised using  percentage-of-completion method. The Group uses judgement to  \\nestimate the future cost-to-completion of the contracts which is used to determine degree of completion of the performance obligation.\\n(b) Useful lives of property, plant and equipment\\n The Group reviews the useful life of property, plant and equipment at the end of each reporting period. This reassessment may result in change in depreciation expense in future periods.Integrated Annual Report 2021-22Consolidated Financial Statements  |  254\\nNotes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements(c) Impairment of goodwill\\n The Group estimates the value-in-use of the cash generating units (CGUs) \\nbased on the future cash flows after considering current economic conditions and trends, estimated future operating results and growth rate and anticipated future economic and regulatory conditions. The estimated cash flows are \\ndeveloped using internal forecasts. The discount rates used for the CGUs \\nrepresent the weighted average cost of capital based on the historical market returns of comparable companies.\\n(d) Fair value measurement of financial instruments\\n When the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded in the balance sheet cannot be measured based on quoted prices in active markets, their fair value is measured using valuation techniques including the Discounted Cash Flow model. The inputs to these models are taken from observable markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgement is required in establishing fair values. Judgements include \\nconsiderations of inputs such as liquidity risk, credit risk and volatility. Changes \\nin assumptions about these factors could affect the reported fair value of financial instruments.\\n(e) Provision for income tax and deferred tax assets\\n The Group uses estimates and judgements based on the relevant rulings in the areas of allocation of revenue, costs, allowances and disallowances which is exercised while determining the provision for income tax. A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and tax losses \\ncan be utilised. Accordingly, the Group exercises its judgement to reassess the \\ncarrying amount of deferred tax assets at the end of each reporting period.(f) Provisions and contingent liabilities\\n The Group estimates the provisions that have present obligations as a result \\nof past events and it is probable that outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligations. These provisions are reviewed at the end of each reporting period and are adjusted to reflect the current best estimates.\\n The Group uses significant judgements to assess contingent liabilities. Contingent liabilities are recognised when there is a possible obligation arising from past events, the existence of which will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Group or a present obligation that arises \\nfrom past events where it is either not probable that an outflow of resources \\nwill be required to settle the obligation or a reliable estimate of the amount cannot be made. Contingent assets are neither recognised nor disclosed in the consolidated financial statements.\\n(g) Employee benefits\\n The accounting of employee benefit plans in the nature of defined benefit requires the Group to use assumptions. These assumptions have been explained under employee benefits note.\\n(h) Leases\\n The Group evaluates if an arrangement qualifies to be a lease as per the \\nrequirements of Ind AS 116. Identification of a lease requires significant \\njudgement. The Group uses significant judgement in assessing the lease term \\n(including anticipated renewals) and the applicable discount rate.\\n The Group determines the lease term as the non-cancellable period of a lease, together with both periods covered by an option to extend the lease if Integrated Annual Report 2021-22Consolidated Financial Statements  |  255\\nNotes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statementsthe Group is reasonably certain to exercise that option; and periods covered \\nby an option to terminate the lease if the Group is reasonably certain not to \\nexercise that option. In assessing whether the Group is reasonably certain to \\nexercise an option to extend a lease, or not to exercise an option to terminate \\na lease, it considers all relevant facts and circumstances that create an \\neconomic incentive for the Group to exercise the option to extend the lease, \\nor not to exercise the option to terminate the lease. The Group revises the \\nlease term if there is a change in the non-cancellable period of a lease.\\n The discount rate is generally based on the incremental borrowing rate \\nspecific to the lease being evaluated or for a portfolio of leases with similar \\ncharacteristics.\\n(i) Impact of COVID-19 (pandemic)\\n The Group has taken into account all the possible impacts of COVID-19 in preparation of these consolidated financial statements, including but not limited to its assessment of, liquidity and going concern assumption, \\nrecoverable values of its financial and non-financial assets, impact on revenue \\nrecognition owing to changes in cost budgets of fixed price contracts, \\nimpact on leases and impact on effectiveness of its hedges. The Group has \\ncarried out this assessment based on available internal and external sources \\nof information upto the date of approval of these consolidated financial \\nstatements and believes that the impact of COVID-19 is not material to these consolidated financial statements and expects to recover the carrying \\namount of its assets. The impact of COVID-19 on the consolidated financial \\nstatements may differ from that estimated as at the date of approval of \\nthese consolidated financial statements owing to the nature and duration of \\nCOVID-19.6) Recent pronouncements\\n Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) notifies new standard or amendments \\nto the existing standards under Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules as issued from time to time. On March 23, 2022, MCA amended the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Amendment Rules, 2022, applicable \\nfrom April 1, 2022, as below:\\n Ind AS 103 – Reference to Conceptual Framework\\n The amendments specify that to qualify for recognition as part of applying \\nthe acquisition method, the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed must meet the definitions of assets and liabilities in the Conceptual Framework \\nfor Financial Reporting under Indian Accounting Standards (Conceptual \\nFramework) issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India at the acquisition date. These changes do not significantly change the requirements of Ind AS 103. The Group does not expect the amendment to have any \\nsignificant impact in its financial statements.\\n Ind AS 16 – Proceeds before intended use\\n The amendments mainly prohibit an entity from deducting from the cost of \\nproperty, plant and equipment amounts received from selling items produced \\nwhile the company is preparing the asset for its intended use. Instead, an \\nentity will recognise such sales proceeds and related cost in profit or loss. The Group does not expect the amendments to have any impact in its recognition of its property, plant and equipment in its financial statements.\\n Ind AS 37 – Onerous Contracts - Costs of Fulfilling a Contract\\n The amendments specify that the ‘cost of fulfilling’ a contract comprises the ‘costs that relate directly to the contract’. Costs that relate directly to a contract can either be incremental costs of fulfilling that contract (examples Integrated Annual Report 2021-22Consolidated Financial Statements  |  256\\nNotes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statementswould be direct labour, materials) or an allocation of other costs that relate \\ndirectly to fulfilling contracts. The amendment is essentially a clarification and the Group does not expect the amendment to have any significant impact in its financial statements.\\n Ind AS 109 – Annual Improvements to Ind AS (2021)\\n The amendment clarifies which fees an entity includes when it applies the  \\n‘10 percent’ test of Ind AS 109 in assessing whether to derecognise a financial \\nliability. The Group does not expect the amendment to have any significant impact in its financial statements.\\n Ind AS 116 – Annual Improvements to Ind AS (2021)\\n The amendments remove the illustration of the reimbursement of leasehold improvements by the lessor in order to resolve any potential confusion regarding the treatment of lease incentives that might arise because of how \\nlease incentives were described in that illustration. The Group does not expect \\nthe amendment to have any significant impact in its financial statements.\\n7) Business combinations\\n The Group accounts for its business combinations under acquisition method \\nof accounting. Acquisition related costs are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss as incurred. The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the condition for recognition are recognised at their fair values at the acquisition date.\\n Purchase consideration paid in excess of the fair value of net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill. Where the fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities exceed the cost of acquisition, after reassessing the fair values of the net assets and contingent liabilities, the excess is recognised as capital reserve. The interest of non-controlling shareholders is initially measured either at \\nfair value or at the non-controlling interests’ proportionate share of the \\nacquiree’s identifiable net assets. The choice of measurement basis is made on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis. Subsequent to acquisition, the carrying amount of non-controlling interests is the amount of those interests at initial \\nrecognition plus the non-controlling interests’ share of subsequent changes in \\nequity of subsidiaries.\\n Business combinations arising from transfers of interests in entities that \\nare under common control are accounted at historical cost. The difference \\nbetween any consideration given and the aggregate historical carrying amounts of assets and liabilities of the acquired entity is recorded in shareholders’ equity.\\n8) Financial assets, financial liabilities and equity instruments\\n Financial assets and liabilities are recognised when the Group becomes a \\nparty to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Financial assets and \\nliabilities are initially measured at fair value. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit \\nor loss) are added to or deducted from the fair value measured on initial \\nrecognition of financial asset or financial liability.\\n The Group derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to \\nthe cash flows from the asset expire, or when it transfers the financial asset \\nand substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity. The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the \\nGroup’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or have expired.Integrated Annual Report 2021-22Consolidated Financial Statements  |  257\\nNotes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements Cash and cash equivalents\\n The Group considers all highly liquid investments, which are readily convertible \\ninto known amounts of cash that are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents consist of balances with banks which are unrestricted for withdrawal and usage.\\n Financial assets at amortised cost\\n Financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost if these \\nfinancial assets are held within a business whose objective is to hold these \\nassets in order to collect contractual cash flows and the contractual terms of the financial assets give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\\n Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income\\n Financial assets are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income if these financial assets are held within a business whose objective is \\nachieved by both collecting contractual cash flows on specified dates that are \\nsolely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding and selling financial assets.\\n The Group has made an irrevocable election to present subsequent changes in the fair value of equity investments not held for trading in other comprehensive income.\\n Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss\\n Financial assets are measured at fair value through profit or loss unless they are measured at amortised cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income on initial recognition. The transaction costs directly attributable to the \\nacquisition of financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss \\nare immediately recognised in statement of profit and loss. Financial liabilities\\n Financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest \\nmethod.\\n Equity instruments\\n An equity instrument is a contract that evidences residual interest in the assets \\nof the company after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued \\nby the Group are recognised at the proceeds received net of direct issue cost.\\n Derivative accounting\\n • Instruments in hedging relationship\\n  The Group designates certain foreign exchange forward, currency options and futures contracts as hedge instruments in respect of foreign exchange risks. These hedges are accounted for as cash flow hedges.\\n  The Group uses hedging instruments that are governed by the policies of the Company and its subsidiaries which are approved by their respective Board of Directors. The policies provide written principles on the use of such financial derivatives consistent with the risk management strategy of the Company and its subsidiaries.\\n  The hedge instruments are designated and documented as hedges at \\nthe inception of the contract. The Group determines the existence of an \\neconomic relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item based on the currency, amount and timing of their respective cash flows. The effectiveness of hedge instruments to reduce the risk associated with the exposure being hedged is assessed and measured at inception and on an ongoing basis. If the hedged future cash flows are no longer Integrated Annual Report 2021-22Consolidated Financial Statements  |  258\\nNotes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statementsexpected to occur, then the amounts that have been accumulated in \\nother equity are immediately reclassified in net foreign exchange gains in the statement of profit and loss.\\n  The effective portion of change in the fair value of the designated hedging instrument is recognised in the other comprehensive income and accumulated under the heading cash flow hedging reserve.\\n  The Group separates the intrinsic value and time value of an option and designates as hedging instruments only the change in intrinsic value of the option. The change in fair value of the intrinsic value and time value of an option is recognised in the other comprehensive income and accounted as a separate component of equity. Such amounts are reclassified into the statement of profit and loss when the related hedged items affect profit and loss.\\n  Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Any \\ngain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated \\nin equity till that time remains and is recognised in statement of profit and loss when the forecasted transaction ultimately affects profit and loss. Any gain or loss is recognised immediately in the statement of profit and loss when the hedge becomes ineffective. • Instruments not in hedging relationship\\n  The Group enters into contracts that are effective as hedges from an \\neconomic perspective, but they do not qualify for hedge accounting. The change in the fair value of such instrument is recognised in the statement \\nof profit and loss.\\n Impairment of financial assets (other than at fair value)\\n The Group assesses at each date of balance sheet whether a financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired. Ind AS 109 requires expected credit \\nlosses to be measured through a loss allowance. The Group recognises lifetime expected losses for all contract assets and / or all trade receivables that do not constitute a financing transaction. In determining the allowances for doubtful trade receivables, the Group has used a practical expedient by computing the expected credit loss allowance for trade receivables based on a provision \\nmatrix. The provision matrix takes into account historical credit loss experience \\nand is adjusted for forward looking information. The expected credit loss allowance is based on the ageing of the receivables that are due and allowance rates used in the provision matrix. For all other financial assets, expected \\ncredit losses are measured at an amount equal to the 12-months expected \\ncredit losses or at an amount equal to the life time expected credit losses if the credit risk on the financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition.Integrated Annual Report 2021-22Consolidated Financial Statements  |  259\\nNotes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements(a) Investments\\n Investments consist of the following:\\n Investments – Non-current\\n(` crore)\\n As at \\nMarch 31, 2022As at \\nMarch 31, 2021\\nInvestments designated at fair value through \\nOCI\\nFully paid equity shares (unquoted)\\nMozido LLC  76  73 \\nFCM LLC  57  55 \\nTaj Air Limited  19  19 \\nPhilippine Dealing System Holdings Corporation  7  7 \\nLess: Impairment in value of investments (123) (116)\\nInvestments carried at amortised costGovernment bonds and securities (quoted)  187  165 \\nCorporate bonds (quoted)  -     10 \\n223  213 \\n Investments – Non-current includes `187 crore and `175 crore as at March 31, 2022 \\nand 2021, respectively, pertains to trusts held for specified purposes.

The Group has a risk management policy which covers risks associated with the financial assets and liabilities. \\nThe risk management policy is approved by the Board of Directors. The focus \\nof the risk management committee is to assess the unpredictability of the financial environment and to mitigate potential adverse effects on the financial performance of the Group.\\n Market risk\\n Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. Such changes in the values of financial instruments may result from changes in the foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, credit, liquidity and other market \\nchanges. The Group’s exposure to market risk is primarily on account of \\nforeign currency exchange rate risk.\\n • Foreign currency exchange rate risk\\n  The fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates may have potential impact on the consolidated statement of profit and loss and other \\ncomprehensive income and equity, where any transaction references \\nmore than one currency or where assets / liabilities are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the respective entities. Considering the countries and economic environment in which the Group operates, its operations are subject to risks arising from fluctuations in \\nexchange rates in those countries. \\n  The Group, as per its risk management policy, uses derivative instruments primarily to hedge foreign exchange. Further, any movement in the \\nfunctional currencies of the various operations of the Group against Integrated Annual Report 2021-22Consolidated Financial Statements  |  270\\nNotes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statementsmajor foreign currencies may impact the Group’s revenue in international \\nbusiness.\\n  The Group evaluates the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations by assessing its exposure to exchange rate risks. It hedges a part of these risks by using derivative financial instruments in line with its risk \\nmanagement policies.\\n  The foreign exchange rate sensitivity is calculated by aggregation of the net foreign exchange rate exposure and a simultaneous parallel foreign \\nexchange rates shift of all the currencies by 10% against the respective functional currencies of Tata Consultancy Services Limited and its subsidiaries.\\n  The following analysis has been worked out based on the net exposures for each of the subsidiaries and Tata Consultancy Services Limited as of the date of balance sheet which could affect the statement of profit and \\nloss and other comprehensive income and equity. Further the exposure \\nas indicated below is mitigated by some of the derivative contracts entered into by the Group as disclosed in note 8(k).\\n  The following table sets forth information relating to unhedged foreign currency exposure as at March 31, 2022:\\n(` crore)\\nUSD EUR GBP Others\\nNet financial assets 2,900 165 84 1,234 \\nNet financial liabilities (8,589) (437) (1,290) (421)\\n  10% appreciation / depreciation of the respective functional currency of Tata Consultancy Services Limited and its subsidiaries with respect \\nto various foreign currencies would result in increase / decrease in the \\nGroup’s profit before taxes by approximately `635 crore for the year ended March 31, 2022.

Hence, the Group is not significantly exposed to interest rate risk.\\n Credit risk\\n Credit risk is the risk of financial loss arising from counterparty failure to repay or service debt according to the contractual terms or obligations. Credit risk encompasses of both, the direct risk of default and the risk of deterioration of creditworthiness as well as concentration of risks. Credit risk is controlled \\nby analysing credit limits and creditworthiness of customers on a continuous \\nbasis to whom the credit has been granted after obtaining necessary approvals for credit.\\n Financial instruments that are subject to concentrations of credit risk principally consist of trade receivables, loans, investments, derivative financial instruments, cash and cash equivalents, bank deposits and other financial \\nassets. Inter-corporate deposits of `6,377 crore are with a financial institution \\nhaving a high credit-rating assigned by credit-rating agencies. Bank deposits Integrated Annual Report 2021-22Consolidated Financial Statements  |  271\\nNotes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statementsinclude an amount of `6,727 crore held with four Indian banks having high \\ncredit rating which are individually in excess of 10% or more of the Group’s total bank deposits as at March 31, 2022. None of the other financial \\ninstruments of the Group result in material concentration of credit risk.\\n • Exposure to credit risk\\n  The carrying amount of financial assets and contract assets represents \\nthe maximum credit exposure. The maximum exposure to credit risk was \\n`1,05,498 crore and `94,201 crore as at March 31, 2022 and 2021, \\nrespectively, being the total of the carrying amount of balances with banks, bank deposits, investments, trade receivables, loan, contract assets and other financial assets.\\n  The Group’s exposure to customers is diversified and no single customer contributes to more than 10% of outstanding trade receivables and contract assets as at March 31, 2022 and 2021.\\n • Geographic concentration of credit risk\\n  Geographic concentration of trade receivables (gross and net of allowances) and contract assets is as follows:\\nAs at March 31, 2022 As at March 31, 2021\\nGross% Net% Gross% Net%\\nUnited States of America 43.79 44.69 41.08 41.83\\nIndia 15.51 13.83 20.31 18.79\\nUnited Kingdom 16.47 16.86 16.37 16.75\\n  Geographical concentration of trade receivables and contract assets is allocated based on the location of the customers.\\n  The allowance for lifetime expected credit loss on trade receivables  for the years ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, was `123 crore and `190 crore respectively.

The \\ncost of the right-of-use asset measured at inception shall comprise of the \\namount of the initial measurement of the lease liability adjusted for any lease \\npayments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives \\nreceived, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to be \\nincurred by the lessee in dismantling and removing the underlying asset or restoring the underlying asset or site on which it is located. The right-of-use \\nasset is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation, \\naccumulated impairment losses, if any and adjusted for any remeasurement of \\nthe lease liability. The right-of-use asset is depreciated using the  \\nstraight-line method from the commencement date over the shorter of  \\nlease term or useful life of right-of-use asset. The estimated useful lives of \\nright-of-use assets are determined on the same basis as those of property, \\nplant and equipment. Right-of-use assets are tested for impairment whenever \\nthere is any indication that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Impairment loss, if any, is recognised in the statement of profit and loss.\\n The Group measures the lease liability at the present value of the lease \\npayments that are not paid at the commencement date of the lease. The lease Integrated Annual Report 2021-22Consolidated Financial Statements  |  275\\nNotes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statementspayments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if that \\nrate can be readily determined. If that rate cannot be readily determined, the \\nGroup uses incremental borrowing rate. For leases with reasonably similar \\ncharacteristics, the Group, on a lease-by-lease basis, may adopt either the \\nincremental borrowing rate specific to the lease or the incremental borrowing rate for the portfolio as a whole. The lease payments shall include fixed \\npayments, variable lease payments, residual value guarantees, exercise price \\nof a purchase option where the Group is reasonably certain to exercise that \\noption and payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term \\nreflects the lessee exercising an option to terminate the lease. The lease \\nliability is subsequently remeasured by increasing the carrying amount to \\nreflect interest on the lease liability, reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made and remeasuring the carrying amount to reflect any \\nreassessment or lease modifications or to reflect revised in-substance fixed \\nlease payments. The Group recognises the amount of the re-measurement of \\nlease liability due to modification as an adjustment to the right-of-use asset \\nand statement of profit and loss depending upon the nature of modification. \\nWhere the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset is reduced to zero and \\nthere is a further reduction in the measurement of the lease liability, the \\nGroup recognises any remaining amount of the re-measurement in statement \\nof profit and loss.\\n The Group has elected not to apply the requirements of Ind AS 116 Leases to short-term leases of all assets that have a lease term of 12 months or less \\nand leases for which the underlying asset is of low value. The lease payments \\nassociated with these leases are recognised as an expense on a straight-line \\nbasis over the lease term.\\n Group as a lessor\\n At the inception of the lease the Group classifies each of its leases as either an operating lease or a finance lease. The Group recognises lease payments \\nreceived under operating leases as income on a straight-line basis over the lease term. In case of a finance lease, finance income is recognised over the \\nlease term based on a pattern reflecting a constant periodic rate of return on \\nthe lessor’s net investment in the lease. When the Group is an intermediate \\nlessor it accounts for its interests in the head lease and the sub-lease \\nseparately. It assesses the lease classification of a sub-lease with reference to the right-of-use asset arising from the head lease, not with reference to \\nthe underlying asset. If a head lease is a short-term lease to which the Group \\napplies the exemption described above, then it classifies the sub-lease as an \\noperating lease. \\n If an arrangement contains lease and non-lease components, the Group \\napplies Ind AS 115 Revenue from contracts with customers to allocate the consideration in the contract.\\n The details of the right-of-use assets held by the Group is as follows:\\n(` crore)\\nAdditions  \\nfor the year ended \\nMarch 31, 2022Net carrying \\namount as at \\nMarch 31, 2022\\nLeasehold land 100 774 \\nBuildings 1,357 6,586 \\nLeasehold improvement  -    23\\nComputer equipment 4 81 \\nSoftware licences 145 133 \\nVehicles 16 32\\nOffice equipment 2 7\\n1,624 7,636 Integrated Annual Report 2021-22Consolidated Financial Statements  |  276\\nNotes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements(` crore)\\nAdditions  \\nfor the year ended \\nMarch 31, 2021Net carrying \\namount as at \\nMarch 31, 2021\\nLeasehold land  -    682 \\nBuildings 1,226 6,758 \\nLeasehold improvement 6 26\\nComputer equipment 102 101 \\nSoftware licences 26 25 \\nVehicles 30 32\\nOffice equipment  1 9\\n1,391 7,633 \\n Depreciation on right-of-use assets is as follows:\\n(` crore)\\nY ear ended \\nMarch 31, 2022Y ear ended \\nMarch 31, 2021\\nLeasehold land  9 8 \\nBuildings 1,465 1,453 \\nLeasehold improvement 6 8\\nComputer equipment 23 12 \\nSoftware licences 38 1 \\nVehicles 16 14\\nOffice equipment 3 4 \\n1,560 1,500 \\n Interest on lease liabilities is `519 crore and `523 crore for the years ended  \\nMarch 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Property, plant and equipment with finite life are evaluated for recoverability whenever there is any indication that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount (i.e. higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the value-in-use) is determined on an \\nindividual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are \\nlargely independent of those from other assets. In such cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash generating unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs. \\n If the recoverable amount of an asset (or CGU) is estimated to be less than \\nits carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or CGU) is reduced to \\nits recoverable amount.

The Group offers a consulting-led, cognitive powered, integrated portfolio of IT, business and engineering services and solutions.\\n Revenue is recognised upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration which the Integrated Annual Report 2021-22Consolidated Financial Statements  |  285\\nNotes forming part of Consolidated Financial StatementsGroup expects to receive in exchange for those products or services.\\n • Revenue from time and material and job contracts is recognised on \\noutput basis measured by units delivered, efforts expended, number of transactions processed, etc. \\n • Revenue related to fixed price maintenance and support services contracts where the Group is standing ready to provide services is \\nrecognised based on time elapsed mode and revenue is straight lined over \\nthe period of performance.\\n • In respect of other fixed-price contracts, revenue is recognised using percentage-of-completion method (‘POC method’) of accounting with contract costs incurred determining the degree of completion of the performance obligation. The contract costs used in computing the revenues include cost of fulfilling warranty obligations.  \\n • Revenue from the sale of distinct internally developed software and \\nmanufactured systems and third party software is recognised upfront \\nat the point in time when the system / software is delivered to the customer. In cases where implementation and / or customisation services rendered significantly modifies or customises the software, these services and software are accounted for as a single performance obligation and \\nrevenue is recognised over time on a POC method. \\n • Revenue from the sale of distinct third party hardware is recognised at \\nthe point in time when control is transferred to the customer. \\n • The solutions offered by the Group may include supply of third-party equipment or software. In such cases, revenue for supply of such third \\nparty products are recorded at gross or net basis depending on whether \\nthe Group is acting as the principal or as an agent of the customer. The Group recognises revenue in the gross amount of consideration when it is acting as a principal and at net amount of consideration when it is acting as an agent.\\n Revenue is measured based on the transaction price, which is the \\nconsideration, adjusted for volume discounts, service level credits, \\nperformance bonuses, price concessions and incentives, if any, as specified in the contract with the customer. Revenue also excludes taxes collected from customers.\\n The Group’s contracts with customers could include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. The Group assesses the \\nproducts / services promised in a contract and identifies distinct performance \\nobligations in the contract. Identification of distinct performance obligation involves judgement to determine the deliverables and the ability of the customer to benefit independently from such deliverables.\\n Judgement is also required to determine the transaction price for the contract and to ascribe the transaction price to each distinct performance \\nobligation. The transaction price could be either a fixed amount of customer \\nconsideration or variable consideration with elements such as volume discounts, service level credits, performance bonuses, price concessions and incentives. The transaction price is also adjusted for the effects of the time \\nvalue of money if the contract includes a significant financing component. Any \\nconsideration payable to the customer is adjusted to the transaction price, unless it is a payment for a distinct product or service from the customer. The estimated amount of variable consideration is adjusted in the transaction price \\nonly to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the \\namount of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur and is reassessed at the end of each reporting period. The Group allocates the elements of variable considerations to all the performance obligations of the contract Integrated Annual Report 2021-22Consolidated Financial Statements  |  286\\nNotes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statementsunless there is observable evidence that they pertain to one or more distinct \\nperformance obligations.\\n The Group exercises judgement in determining whether the performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time or over a period of time. The Group \\nconsiders indicators such as how customer consumes benefits as services \\nare rendered or who controls the asset as it is being created or existence of enforceable right to payment for performance to date and alternate use of such product or service, transfer of significant risks and rewards to the \\ncustomer, acceptance of delivery by the customer, etc.\\n Contract fulfilment costs are generally expensed as incurred except for certain software licence costs which meet the criteria for capitalisation. Such costs are \\namortised over the contractual period or useful life of licence, whichever is less. The assessment of this criteria requires the application of judgement, in particular when considering if costs generate or enhance resources to be used to satisfy future performance obligations and whether costs are expected to \\nbe recovered.\\n Contract assets are recognised when there are excess of revenues earned \\nover billings on contracts. Contract assets are classified as unbilled receivables (only act of invoicing is pending) when there is unconditional right to receive cash, and only passage of time is required, as per contractual terms. \\n Unearned and deferred revenue (“contract liability”) is recognised when there \\nare billings in excess of revenues.\\n The billing schedules agreed with customers include periodic performance \\nbased payments and / or milestone based progress payments. Invoices are payable within contractually agreed credit period. In accordance with Ind AS 37, the Group recognises an onerous contract provision when the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under a contract exceed the economic benefits to be received. \\n Contracts are subject to modification to account for changes in contract \\nspecification and requirements. The Group reviews modification to contract \\nin conjunction with the original contract, basis which the transaction price could be allocated to a new performance obligation, or transaction price of an existing obligation could undergo a change. In the event transaction price is \\nrevised for existing obligation, a cumulative adjustment is accounted for.\\n The Group disaggregates revenue from contracts with customers by nature of services, industry verticals and geography.\\n Revenue disaggregation by nature of services is as follows:\\n(` crore)\\nY ear ended \\nMarch 31, 2022Y ear ended \\nMarch 31, 2021\\nConsultancy services 1,90,289 1,62,508\\nSale of equipment and software licences 1,465 1,669 \\n1,91,754 1,64,177\\n Revenue disaggregation by industry vertical and geography has been included \\nin segment information (Refer note 19).\\n While disclosing the aggregate amount of transaction price yet to be recognised as revenue towards unsatisfied (or partially satisfied) performance \\nobligations, along with the broad time band for the expected time to recognise \\nthose revenues, the Group has applied the practical expedient in Ind AS 115. Integrated Annual Report 2021-22Consolidated Financial Statements  |  287\\nNotes forming part of Consolidated Financial StatementsAccordingly, the Group has not disclosed the aggregate transaction price \\nallocated to unsatisfied (or partially satisfied) performance obligations which pertain to contracts where revenue recognised corresponds to the value \\ntransferred to customer typically involving time and material, outcome based \\nand event based contracts. \\n Unsatisfied (or partially satisfied) performance obligations are subject to variability due to several factors such as terminations, changes in scope of contracts, periodic revalidations of the estimates, economic factors (changes in currency rates, tax laws etc). The aggregate value of transaction price allocated \\nto unsatisfied (or partially satisfied) performance obligations is `1,13,868 crore \\nout of which 56.54% is expected to be recognised as revenue in the next year \\nand the balance thereafter.

Current and deferred taxes are recognised in statement of profit and loss, except when they relate to items that are recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case, the current and deferred tax are also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.\\n Current income taxes\\n The current income tax expense includes income taxes payable by the Company and its subsidiaries in India and overseas. The current tax payable by the Company and its subsidiaries in India is Indian income tax payable on worldwide income after taking credit for tax relief available for export operations in Special Economic Zones (SEZs).\\n Current income tax payable by overseas branches of the Company is computed in accordance with the tax laws applicable in the jurisdiction in which the respective branch operates. The taxes paid are generally available for set off against the Indian income tax liability of the Company’s worldwide income.\\n The current income tax expense for overseas subsidiaries has been computed based on the tax laws applicable to each subsidiary in the respective jurisdiction in which it operates.\\n Advance taxes and provisions for current income taxes are presented in the balance sheet after off-setting advance tax paid and income tax provision \\narising in the same tax jurisdiction and where the relevant tax paying unit \\nintends to settle the asset and liability on a net basis.\\n Deferred income taxes\\n Deferred income tax is recognised using the balance sheet approach. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognised for deductible and taxable temporary differences arising between the tax base of assets and liabilities and their carrying amount, except when the deferred income tax arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss at the time of the transaction. \\n Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses \\ncan be utilised. \\n The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each \\nreporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised.\\n Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences except in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries where timing of the reversal of the temporary \\ndifference can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference \\nwill not reverse in the foreseeable future. \\n Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using substantively enacted tax \\nrates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the temporary \\ndifferences are expected to be received or settled.\\n For operations carried out in SEZs, deferred tax assets or liabilities, if any, have \\nbeen established for the tax consequences of those temporary differences \\nbetween the carrying values of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases that reverse after the tax holiday ends.\\n Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the relevant entity intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.Integrated Annual Report 2021-22Consolidated Financial Statements  |  299\\nNotes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements Deferred tax assets include Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) paid in accordance \\nwith the tax laws in India, to the extent it would be available for set off against future current income tax liability.

The business segments comprise: 1) Banking, Financial Services  and Insurance, 2) Manufacturing, 3) Retail and Consumer Business,  4) Communication, Media and T echnology, 5) Life Sciences and Healthcare \\nand 6) Others such as Energy, Resources and Utilities, s-Governance and \\nProducts. \\n Revenue and expenses directly attributable to segments are reported under \\neach reportable segment. Expenses which are not directly identifiable to \\neach reporting segment have been allocated on the basis of associated revenue of the segment or manpower efforts. All other expenses which are \\nnot attributable or allocable to segments have been disclosed as unallocable \\nexpenses.\\n The assets and liabilities of the Group are used interchangeably amongst segments. Allocation of such assets and liabilities is not practicable and any forced allocation would not result in any meaningful segregation. Hence assets and liabilities have not been identified to any of the reportable segments. \\n Summarised segment information for the years ended March 31,2022 and 2021, is as follows:\\nY ear ended March 31, 2022 (` crore)\\nBanking, \\nFinancial \\nServices and \\nInsuranceManufacturing Retail and \\nConsumer \\nBusinessCommunication, \\nMedia and \\nT echnologyLife \\nSciences \\nand \\nHealthcareOthers T otal\\nRevenue from \\noperations75,126 18,610 30,715 31,874 20,462 14,967 1,91,754\\nSegment result 20,174 5,602 8,534 9,518 6,139 3,090  53,057 \\nT otal unallocable \\nexpenses5,388 \\nOperating income 47,669 \\nOther income 4,018 \\nProfit before tax 51,687 \\nTax expense 13,238 \\nProfit for the year 38,449 \\nDepreciation and amortisation \\nexpense \\n(unallocable)4,604 \\nSignificant non-cash \\nitems (allocable)14 (3) 10 2 (1) 113 135 Integrated Annual Report 2021-22Consolidated Financial Statements  |  304\\nNotes forming part of Consolidated Financial StatementsY ear ended March 31, 2021 (` crore)\\nBanking, \\nFinancial \\nServices and \\nInsuranceManufacturing Retail and \\nConsumer \\nBusinessCommunication, \\nMedia and \\nT echnologyLife \\nSciences \\nand \\nHealthcareOthers T otal\\nRevenue from \\noperations65,634 15,950 25,589 27,077 16,968 12,959 1,64,177\\nSegment result 18,681 4,483 7,151 8,010 5,253 2,968 46,546 \\nT otal unallocable expenses* 5,920 \\nOperating income\\n40,626 \\nOther income 3,134 \\nProfit before tax 43,760 \\nTax expense 11,198 \\nProfit for the year 32,562 \\nDepreciation and amortisation \\nexpense \\n(unallocable)4,065 \\nSignificant non-cash \\nitems (allocable)15 1 78 9 1 97 201 \\n *Includes the provision towards legal claim of `1,218 crore.

In addition to above, in October 2014, Epic Systems Corporation (referred to as Epic) filed a legal claim against the Company in the Court of Western District Madison, Wisconsin alleging unauthorised access to \\nand download of their confidential information and use thereof in the \\ndevelopment of the Company’s product MedMantra. In April 2016, the Company received an unfavourable jury verdict awarding damages of `7,115 crore (US $940 million) to Epic which was thereafter reduced \\nby the Trial Court to `3,179 crore (US $420 million). Pursuant to \\nreaffirmation of the District Court order in March 2019, the Company filed an appeal in the Appeals Court to fully set aside the Order. Epic also filed a cross appeal challenging the reduction by the District Court judge of `757 crore (US $100 million) award and `1,514 crore  (US $200 million) in punitive damages. On August 20, 2020, the Appea ls \\nCourt vacated the award of `2,119 crore (US $280 million) in punitive damages considering the award to be constitutionally excessive and remanded the case back to District Court with instructions to reassess and reduce the punitive damages award to at most `1,060 crore   \\n(US $140 million), affirmed the District Court’s decision vacating the jury’s award of `757 crore (US $100 million) in compensatory damages for alleged use of “other confidential information” by the Company, and affirmed the District Court’s decision upholding the jury’s award of `1,060 crore (US $140 million) in compensatory damages for use of \\nthe comparative analysis by the Company. The proceedings for assessing \\npunitive damages have been remanded back to the District Court. Both the Company and Epic have filed their briefs at the District Court in \\nrelation to punitive damages. The matter is under consideration by the \\nDistrict Court. On April 8, 2021, Epic approached the Supreme Court seeking review of the order of the Appeals Court vacating the award of `2,119 crore (US $280 million) towards punitive damages and remanding back to District Court with an instruction to reassess the punitive Integrated Annual Report 2021-22Consolidated Financial Statements  |  306\\nNotes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statementsdamages, to no more than `1,060 crore (US $140 million). On  \\nMarch 21, 2022, Supreme Court denied Epic’s petition seeking review  of the order. The Company will continue to pursue all legal options \\navailable in the matter. Considering all the facts and various legal \\nprecedence, on a conservative and prudent basis, the Company provided `1,218 crore (US $165 million) towards this legal claim in its statement of profit and loss for three month period ended September 30, 2020. \\nThis was presented as an “exceptional item” in the consolidated statement \\nof profit and loss.\\n  Pursuant to US Court procedures, a Letter of Credit has been made available to Epic for `3,331 crore (US $440 million) as financial security in order to stay execution of the judgement pending post-appeal proceedings and conclusion. • Letter of comfort\\n  The Company has given letter of comfort to banks for credit facilities availed by its subsidiaries. As per the terms of letter of comfort, the Company undertakes not to divest its ownership interest directly or \\nindirectly in the subsidiary and provide such managerial, technical and \\nfinancial assistance to ensure continued successful operations of the subsidiary.\\n The amounts assessed as contingent liability do not include interest that could be claimed by counter parties.Integrated Annual Report 2021-22Consolidated Financial Statements  |  307\\nNotes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements21) Statement of net assets, profit and loss and other comprehensive income attributable to owners and non-controlling interests \\nName of the entity Country of \\nincorporation% of \\nvoting \\npower \\nas at \\nMarch \\n31, 2022% of \\nvoting \\npower \\nas at \\nMarch \\n31, 2021Net assets, i.e. total assets \\nminus total liabilitiesShare in Profit or loss Share in other \\ncomprehensive incomeShare in total \\ncomprehensive income\\nAs % of \\nconsolidated \\nnet assetsAmount \\n(` crore)As % of \\nconsolidated \\nprofit or lossAmount \\n(` crore)As % of \\nconsolidated \\nother \\ncomprehensive \\nincomeAmount \\n(` crore)As % of total \\ncomprehensive \\nincomeAmount \\n(` crore)\\nTata Consultancy \\nServices LimitedIndia  -

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in \\naccordance with SAs will always detect a material \\nmisstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could \\nreasonably be expected to influence the economic \\ndecisions of users taken on the basis of these standalone financial statements.Management’s and Board of Directors’ Responsibilities for the Standalone Financial Statements\\nThe Company’s Management and Board of Directors \\nare responsible for the matters stated in Section \\n134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation of these standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view of the state of affairs, profit/loss and other comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows of the Company in accordance \\nwith the accounting principles generally accepted \\nin India, including the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) specified under Section 133 of the Act.

We \\nalso:\\n• Identify and assess the risks of material \\nmisstatement of the standalone financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for \\nour opinion. The risk of not detecting a material \\nmisstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, \\nmisrepresentations, or the override of internal \\ncontrol.\\n• Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under Section 143(3)(i) of the \\nAct, we are also responsible for expressing our \\nopinion on whether the Company has adequate internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements in place and the \\noperating effectiveness of such controls.\\n• Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting \\npolicies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Management and Board of Directors.\\n• Conclude on the appropriateness of the \\nManagement and Board of Directors use \\nof the going concern basis of accounting in preparation of standalone financial statements and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant \\ndoubt on the Company’s ability to continue \\nas a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to \\nthe related disclosures in the standalone \\nfinancial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. \\nHowever, future events or conditions may cause \\nthe Company to cease to continue as a going concern.\\n• Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the standalone financial statements, \\nincluding the disclosures, and whether the \\nstandalone financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant \\naudit findings, including any significant deficiencies in \\ninternal control that we identify during our audit.\\nWe also provide those charged with governance with \\na statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on \\nour independence, and where applicable, related \\nsafeguards.\\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged \\nwith governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the standalone financial statements of the current \\nperiod and are therefore the key audit matters. \\nWe describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare \\ncircumstances, we determine that a matter should \\nnot be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits \\nof such communication.Integrated Annual Report 2021-22Standalone Financial Statements  |  322\\nReport on Other Legal and Regulatory \\nRequirements\\n1.

The Company offers a consulting-led, cognitive powered, integrated portfolio of IT, business and engineering services and solutions. This is delivered through its unique Location-Independent Agile delivery model recognised as a benchmark of excellence in software development.\\n The Company is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in India. The address of its corporate office is TCS House, Raveline Street, Fort, Mumbai - 400001. As at March 31, 2022, Tata Sons Private Limited, the holding company owned 72.27% of the Company’s equity share capital.\\n The Board of Directors approved the standalone financial statements for the \\nyear ended March 31, 2022 and authorised for issue on April 11, 2022.\\n2) Statement of compliance\\n These standalone financial statements have been prepared in accordance with \\nthe Indian Accounting Standards (referred to as “Ind AS”) as prescribed under section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 read with the Companies (Indian \\nAccounting Standards) Rules as amended from time to time.\\n3) Basis of preparation\\n These standalone financial statements have been prepared on historical cost \\nbasis except for certain financial instruments and defined benefit plans which are measured at fair value or amortised cost at the end of each reporting \\nperiod. Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for goods and services. Fair value is the price that would be \\nreceived to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. All assets and liabilities \\nhave been classified as current and non-current as per the Company’s normal \\noperating cycle. Based on the nature of services rendered to customers and time elapsed between deployment of resources and the realisation in cash and cash equivalents of the consideration for such services rendered, the \\nCompany has considered an operating cycle of 12 months.\\n The statement of cash flows have been prepared under indirect method, \\nwhereby profit or loss is adjusted for the effects of transactions of a non-cash nature, any deferrals or accruals of past or future operating cash receipts or payments and items of income or expense associated with investing or financing cash flows. The cash flows from operating, investing and financing \\nactivities of the Company are segregated. The Company considers all highly \\nliquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value to be cash equivalents.\\n These standalone financial statements have been prepared in Indian Rupee (`) which is the functional currency of the Company. Foreign currency \\ntransactions are recorded at exchange rates prevailing on the date of the \\ntransaction. Foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities are retranslated at the exchange rate prevailing on the balance sheet dates and exchange gains and losses arising on settlement and restatement are \\nrecognised in the statement of profit and loss. Non-monetary assets and \\nliabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in foreign currencies are not retranslated.\\n The significant accounting policies used in preparation of the standalone financial statements have been discussed in the respective notes.Integrated Annual Report 2021-22Standalone Financial Statements  |  340\\nNotes forming part of Standalone Financial Statements4) Use of estimates and judgements\\n The preparation of standalone financial statements in conformity with the \\nrecognition and measurement principles of Ind AS requires management of the Company to make estimates and judgements that affect the reported \\nbalances of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent liabilities as at the \\ndate of standalone financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses for the periods presented.\\n Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and future periods are affected.\\n The Company uses the following critical accounting estimates in preparation \\nof its standalone financial statements:\\n(a) Revenue recognition\\n Revenue for fixed-price contracts is recognised using percentage-of-\\ncompletion method. The Company uses judgement to estimate the future cost-to-completion of the contracts which is used to determine degree of completion of the performance obligation.\\n(b) Useful lives of property, plant and equipment\\n The Company reviews the useful life of property, plant and equipment at \\nthe end of each reporting period. This reassessment may result in change in \\ndepreciation expense in future periods.\\n(c) Impairment of investments in subsidiaries\\n The Company reviews its carrying value of investments carried at cost (net of impairment, if any) annually, or more frequently when there is indication for impairment. If the recoverable amount is less than its carrying amount, the impairment loss is accounted for in the statement of profit and loss.\\n(d) Fair value measurement of financial instruments\\n When the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded in the balance sheet cannot be measured based on quoted prices in active \\nmarkets, their fair value is measured using valuation techniques including the \\nDiscounted Cash Flow model. The inputs to these models are taken from observable markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgement is required in establishing fair values. Judgements include considerations of inputs such as liquidity risk, credit risk and volatility. Changes \\nin assumptions about these factors could affect the reported fair value of \\nfinancial instruments.\\n(e) Provision for income tax and deferred tax assets\\n The Company uses estimates and judgements based on the relevant rulings in the areas of allocation of revenue, costs, allowances and disallowances which is exercised while determining the provision for income tax. A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be \\navailable against which the deductible temporary differences and tax losses can \\nbe utilised. Accordingly, the Company exercises its judgement to reassess the carrying amount of deferred tax assets at the end of each reporting period.\\n(f) Provisions and contingent liabilities\\n The Company estimates the provisions that have present obligations as \\na result of past events and it is probable that outflow of resources will be \\nrequired to settle the obligations. These provisions are reviewed at the end of each reporting period and are adjusted to reflect the current best estimates. Integrated Annual Report 2021-22Standalone Financial Statements  |  341\\nNotes forming part of Standalone Financial Statements The Company uses significant judgements to assess contingent liabilities. \\nContingent liabilities are recognised when there is a possible obligation arising from past events, the existence of which will be confirmed only by the \\noccurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not \\nwholly within the control of the Company or a present obligation that arises from past events where it is either not probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation or a reliable estimate of the amount \\ncannot be made. Contingent assets are neither recognised nor disclosed in the \\nstandalone financial statements.\\n(g) Employee benefits\\n The accounting of employee benefit plans in the nature of defined benefit requires the Company to use assumptions. These assumptions have been explained under employee benefits note.\\n(h) Leases\\n The Company evaluates if an arrangement qualifies to be a lease as per the \\nrequirements of Ind AS 116. Identification of a lease requires significant \\njudgement. The Company uses significant judgement in assessing the lease term (including anticipated renewals) and the applicable discount rate.\\n The Company determines the lease term as the non-cancellable period of a lease, together with both periods covered by an option to extend the lease \\nif the Company is reasonably certain to exercise that option; and periods \\ncovered by an option to terminate the lease if the Company is reasonably certain not to exercise that option. In assessing whether the Company is \\nreasonably certain to exercise an option to extend a lease, or not to exercise \\nan option to terminate a lease, it considers all relevant facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive for the Company to exercise the option to extend the lease, or not to exercise the option to terminate the lease. The Company revises the lease term if there is a change in the non-cancellable period of a lease.\\n The discount rate is generally based on the incremental borrowing rate specific to the lease being evaluated or for a portfolio of leases with similar characteristics.\\n(i) Impact of COVID-19 (pandemic)\\n The Company has taken into account all the possible impacts of COVID-19 in \\npreparation of these standalone financial statements, including but not limited \\nto its assessment of, liquidity and going concern assumption, recoverable values of its financial and non-financial assets, impact on revenue recognition owing to changes in cost budgets of fixed price contracts, impact on leases and impact on effectiveness of its hedges. The Company has carried out this \\nassessment based on available internal and external sources of information \\nupto the date of approval of these standalone financial statements and believes that the impact of COVID-19 is not material to these standalone financial statements and expects to recover the carrying amount of its assets. \\nThe impact of COVID-19 on the standalone financial statements may differ \\nfrom that estimated as at the date of approval of these standalone financial statements owing to the nature and duration of COVID-19.\\n5) Recent pronouncements\\n Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) notifies new standard or amendments \\nto the existing standards under Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) \\nRules as issued from time to time. On March 23, 2022, MCA amended the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Amendment Rules, 2022, applicable from April 1, 2022, as below:Integrated Annual Report 2021-22Standalone Financial Statements  |  342\\nNotes forming part of Standalone Financial Statements Ind AS 103 – Reference to Conceptual Framework\\n The amendments specify that to qualify for recognition as part of applying \\nthe acquisition method, the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed \\nmust meet the definitions of assets and liabilities in the Conceptual Framework \\nfor Financial Reporting under Indian Accounting Standards (Conceptual Framework) issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India at the acquisition date. These changes do not significantly change the requirements of Ind AS 103. The Company does not expect the amendment to have any \\nsignificant impact in its financial statements.\\n Ind AS 16 – Proceeds before intended use\\n The amendments mainly prohibit an entity from deducting from the cost of \\nproperty, plant and equipment amounts received from selling items produced while the company is preparing the asset for its intended use. Instead, an entity will recognise such sales proceeds and related cost in profit or loss. \\nThe Company does not expect the amendments to have any impact in its \\nrecognition of its property, plant and equipment in its financial statements.\\n Ind AS 37 – Onerous Contracts - Costs of Fulfilling a Contract\\n The amendments specify that that the ‘cost of fulfilling’ a contract comprises the ‘costs that relate directly to the contract’. Costs that relate directly to a contract can either be incremental costs of fulfilling that contract (examples \\nwould be direct labour, materials) or an allocation of other costs that relate \\ndirectly to fulfilling contracts. The amendment is essentially a clarification and the Company does not expect the amendment to have any significant impact \\nin its financial statements. Ind AS 109 – Annual Improvements to Ind AS (2021)\\n The amendment clarifies which fees an entity includes when it applies the  \\n‘10 percent’ test of Ind AS 109 in assessing whether to derecognise a financial \\nliability. The Company does not expect the amendment to have any significant \\nimpact in its financial statements.\\n Ind AS 116 – Annual Improvements to Ind AS (2021)\\n The amendments remove the illustration of the reimbursement of leasehold improvements by the lessor in order to resolve any potential confusion regarding the treatment of lease incentives that might arise because of how lease incentives were described in that illustration. The Company does \\nnot expect the amendment to have any significant impact in its financial \\nstatements.\\n6) Financial assets, financial liabilities and equity instruments\\n Financial assets and liabilities are recognised when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Financial assets and liabilities are initially measured at fair value. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities \\n(other than financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit \\nor loss) are added to or deducted from the fair value measured on initial recognition of financial asset or financial liability.\\n The Company derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or when it transfers the financial asset \\nand substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another \\nentity. The Company derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Company’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or have expired.Integrated Annual Report 2021-22Standalone Financial Statements  |  343\\nNotes forming part of Standalone Financial Statements Cash and cash equivalents\\n The Company considers all highly liquid investments, which are readily \\nconvertible into known amounts of cash that are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value, to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents consist \\nof balances with banks which are unrestricted for withdrawal and usage.\\n Financial assets at amortised cost\\n Financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost if these \\nfinancial assets are held within a business whose objective is to hold these assets in order to collect contractual cash flows and the contractual terms of the financial assets give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely \\npayments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\\n Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income\\n Financial assets are measured at fair value through other comprehensive \\nincome if these financial assets are held within a business whose objective is \\nachieved by both collecting contractual cash flows on specified dates that are \\nsolely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding and selling financial assets.\\n The Company has made an irrevocable election to present subsequent changes in the fair value of equity investments not held for trading in other \\ncomprehensive income.\\n Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss\\n Financial assets are measured at fair value through profit or loss unless they are measured at amortised cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income on initial rec ognition. The transaction costs directly attributable to the \\nacquisition of financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss \\nare immediately recognised in statement of profit and loss.\\n Investment in subsidiaries\\n Investment in subsidiaries are measured at cost less impairment loss, if any.\\n Financial liabilities\\n Financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.\\n Equity instruments\\n An equity instrument is a contract that evidences residual interest in the assets of the company after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the Company are recognised at the proceeds received net of direct issue cost.\\n Derivative accounting\\n • Instruments in hedging relationship\\n  The Company designates certain foreign exchange forward, currency options and futures contracts as hedge instruments in respect of foreign exchange risks. These hedges are accounted for as cash flow hedges.\\n  The Company uses hedging instruments that are governed by the policies of the Company which are approved by the Board of Directors. The policies provide written principles on the use of such financial derivatives \\nconsistent with the risk management strategy of the Company.Integrated Annual Report 2021-22Standalone Financial Statements  |  344\\nNotes forming part of Standalone Financial Statements  The hedge instruments are designated and documented as hedges at the \\ninception of the contract. The Company determines the existence of an economic relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item \\nbased on the currency, amount and timing of their respective cash flows. \\nThe effectiveness of hedge instruments to reduce the risk associated with the exposure being hedged is assessed and measured at inception and on an ongoing basis. If the hedged future cash flows are no longer \\nexpected to occur, then the amounts that have been accumulated in \\nother equity are immediately reclassified in net foreign exchange gains in the statement of profit and loss.\\n  The effective portion of change in the fair value of the designated hedging instrument is recognised in the other comprehensive income and accumulated under the heading cash flow hedging reserve.\\n  The Company separates the intrinsic value and time value of an option and designates as hedging instruments only the change in intrinsic value of the option. The change in fair value of the intrinsic value and time value of an option is recognised in the other comprehensive income \\nand accounted as a separate component of equity. Such amounts are \\nreclassified into the statement of profit and loss when the related hedged items affect profit and loss.\\n  Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires \\nor is sold, terminated or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Any \\ngain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity till that time remains and is recognised in the statement of profit and loss when the forecasted transaction ultimately affects profit and loss. Any gain or loss is recognised immediately in the statement of profit and loss when the hedge becomes ineffective.\\n • Instruments not in hedging relationship\\n  The Company enters into contracts that are effective as hedges from an \\neconomic perspective, but they do not qualify for hedge accounting. The \\nchange in the fair value of such instrument is recognised in the statement of profit and loss.\\n Impairment of financial assets (other than at fair value)\\n The Company assesses at each date of balance sheet whether a financial asset \\nor a group of financial assets is impaired.\\n Ind AS 109 requires expected credit losses to be measured through a loss \\nallowance. The Company recognises lifetime expected losses for all contract assets and / or all trade receivables that do not constitute a financing transaction. In determining the allowances for doubtful trade receivables, the \\nCompany has used a practical expedient by computing the expected credit \\nloss allowance for trade receivables based on a provision matrix. The provision matrix takes into account historical credit loss experience and is adjusted for forward looking information. The expected credit loss allowance is based on \\nthe ageing of the receivables that are due and allowance rates used in the \\nprovision matrix. For all other financial assets, expected credit losses are measured at an amount equal to the 12-months expected credit losses or at an amount equal to the life time expected credit losses if the credit risk on the \\nfinancial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition.Integrated Annual Report 2021-22Standalone Financial Statements  |  345\\nNotes forming part of Standalone Financial Statements(a) Investments\\n Investments consist of the following:\\n Investments – Non-current\\n(` crore)\\n As at \\nMarch 31, 2022As at \\nMarch 31, 2021\\nInvestment in subsidiaries\\nFully paid equity shares (unquoted)  2,405  2,405 \\nInvestments designated at fair value through \\nOCI\\nFully paid equity shares (unquoted)\\nTaj Air Limited  19  19 \\nLess: Impairment in value of investments  (19)  (19)\\n 2,405  2,405 \\n Investments – Current\\n(` crore)\\n As at \\nMarch 31, 2022As at \\nMarch 31, 2021\\nInvestments carried at fair value through \\nprofit or loss\\nMutual fund units (quoted)  884  4,068 \\nInvestments carried at fair value through OCIGovernment bonds and securities (quoted)  25,667  23,670 \\nCorporate bonds (quoted)  1,242  450 \\nInvestments carried at amortised cost\\nCertificate of deposits (quoted)  99  -    \\nCommercial papers (quoted)  381  136 \\nTreasury bills (quoted)  989  -    \\n 29,262  28,324 \\n Government bonds and securities includes bonds pledged with bank for credit facility \\nand with manager to the buy-back amounting to `3,560 crore and `1,650 crore as at March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

The Company has a risk \\nmanagement policy which covers risks associated with the financial assets and liabilities. The risk management policy is approved by the Board of Directors. The focus of the risk management committee is to assess the unpredictability of the financial environment and to mitigate potential adverse effects on the \\nfinancial performance of the Company. Market risk\\n Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial \\ninstrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. Such changes in the values of financial instruments may result from changes in the foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, credit, liquidity and other market changes. The Company’s exposure to market risk is primarily on account of \\nforeign currency exchange rate risk.\\n • Foreign currency exchange rate risk\\n  The fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates may have potential \\nimpact on the statement of profit and loss and other comprehensive income and equity, where any transaction references more than one \\ncurrency or where assets / liabilities are denominated in a currency other \\nthan the functional currency of the Company.\\n  Considering the countries and economic environment in which the \\nCompany operates, its operations are subject to risks arising from \\nfluctuations in exchange rates in those countries.\\n  The Company, as per its risk management policy, uses derivative \\ninstruments primarily to hedge foreign exchange. Further, any movement \\nin the functional currency of the various operations of the Company against major foreign currencies may impact the Company’s revenue in international business.\\n  The Company evaluates the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations by assessing its exposure to exchange rate risks. It hedges a part of these risks by using derivative financial instruments in line with its risk management policies.\\n  The foreign exchange rate sensitivity is calculated by aggregation of the net foreign exchange rate exposure and a simultaneous parallel foreign Integrated Annual Report 2021-22Standalone Financial Statements  |  357\\nNotes forming part of Standalone Financial Statementsexchange rates shift of all the currencies by 10% against the functional \\ncurrency of the Company.\\n  The following analysis has been worked out based on the net exposures of the Company as of the date of balance sheet which could affect the statements of profit and loss and other comprehensive income and equity.

Hence, the Company is not significantly exposed to interest rate risk.\\n Credit risk\\n Credit risk is the risk of financial loss arising from counterparty failure to repay or service debt according to the contractual terms or obligations. Credit risk encompasses of both, the direct risk of default and the risk of deterioration of creditworthiness as well as concentration of risks. Credit risk is controlled by analysing credit limits and creditworthiness of customers on a continuous basis to whom the credit has been granted after obtaining necessary approvals for credit.\\n Financial instruments that are subject to concentrations of credit risk principally consist of trade receivables, loans, investments, derivative financial instruments, cash and cash equivalents, bank deposits and other financial assets. Inter-corporate deposits of `5,386 crore are with a financial institution having a high credit-rating assigned by credit-rating agencies. Bank deposits include an amount of `4,800 crore held with three Indian banks having high \\ncredit rating which is individually in excess of 10% or more of the Company’s \\ntotal bank deposits as at March 31, 2022. None of the other financial \\ninstruments of the Company result in material concentration of credit risk.\\n • Exposure to credit risk\\n  The carrying amount of financial assets and contract assets represents \\nthe maximum credit exposure.

The \\ncost of the right-of-use asset measured at inception shall comprise of the \\namount of the initial measurement of the lease liability adjusted for any lease \\npayments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives \\nreceived, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to be \\nincurred by the lessee in dismantling and removing the underlying asset or restoring the underlying asset or site on which it is located. The right-of-use \\nasset is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation, \\naccumulated impairment losses, if any and adjusted for any remeasurement of \\nthe lease liability. The right-of-use asset is depreciated using the  \\nstraight-line method from the commencement date over the shorter of lease \\nterm or useful life of right-of-use asset. The estimated useful lives of  \\nright-of-use assets are determined on the same basis as those of property, \\nplant and equipment. Right-of-use assets are tested for impairment whenever \\nthere is any indication that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Impairment loss, if any, is recognised in the statement of profit and loss.\\n The Company measures the lease liability at the present value of the lease \\npayments that are not paid at the commencement date of the lease. The lease Integrated Annual Report 2021-22Standalone Financial Statements  |  362\\nNotes forming part of Standalone Financial Statementspayments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if that \\nrate can be readily determined. If that rate cannot be readily determined, the \\nCompany uses incremental borrowing rate. For leases with reasonably similar \\ncharacteristics, the Company, on a lease-by-lease basis, may adopt either the \\nincremental borrowing rate specific to the lease or the incremental borrowing rate for the portfolio as a whole. The lease payments shall include fixed \\npayments, variable lease payments, residual value guarantees, exercise price \\nof a purchase option where the Company is reasonably certain to exercise \\nthat option and payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease \\nterm reflects the lessee exercising an option to terminate the lease. The lease \\nliability is subsequently remeasured by increasing the carrying amount to \\nreflect interest on the lease liability, reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made and remeasuring the carrying amount to reflect any \\nreassessment or lease modifications or to reflect revised in-substance fixed \\nlease payments. The Company recognises the amount of the re-measurement \\nof lease liability due to modification as an adjustment to the right-of-use asset \\nand statement of profit and loss depending upon the nature of modification. \\nWhere the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset is reduced to zero \\nand there is a further reduction in the measurement of the lease liability, \\nthe Company recognises any remaining amount of the re-measurement in \\nstatement of profit and loss.\\n The Company has elected not to apply the requirements of Ind AS 116 Leases to short-term leases of all assets that have a lease term of 12 months or less \\nand leases for which the underlying asset is of low value. The lease payments \\nassociated with these leases are recognised as an expense on a straight-line \\nbasis over the lease term.\\n Company as a lessor\\n At the inception of the lease the Company classifies each of its leases as \\neither an operating lease or a finance lease. The Company recognises lease payments received under operating leases as income on a straight-line basis over the lease term.  In case of a finance lease, finance income is recognised over the lease term based on a pattern reflecting a constant periodic rate \\nof return on the lessor’s net investment in the lease.

The Company offers a consulting-led, cognitive powered, integrated portfolio of IT, business and engineering services and \\nsolutions.  Revenue is recognised upon transfer of control of promised products or \\nservices to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration which the Company expects to receive in exchange for those products or services.\\n • Revenue from time and material and job contracts is recognised on \\noutput basis measured by units delivered, efforts expended, number of \\ntransactions processed, etc.\\n • Revenue related to fixed price maintenance and support services contracts where the Company is standing ready to provide services is \\nrecognised based on time elapsed mode and revenue is straight-lined \\nover the period of performance.\\n • In respect of other fixed-price contracts, revenue is recognised using percentage-of-completion method (‘POC method’) of accounting with contract costs incurred determining the degree of completion of the performance obligation. The contract costs used in computing the \\nrevenues include cost of fulfilling warranty obligations.\\n • Revenue from the sale of distinct internally developed software and \\nmanufactured systems and third party software is recognised upfront at the point in time when the system / software is delivered to the \\ncustomer. In cases where implementation and / or customisation services \\nrendered significantly modifies or customises the software, these services and software are accounted for as a single performance obligation and revenue is recognised over time on a POC method.\\n • Revenue from the sale of distinct third party hardware is recognised at the point in time when control is transferred to the customer.\\n • The solutions offered by the Company may include supply of third-party equipment or software. In such cases, revenue for supply of such third party products are recorded at gross or net basis depending on whether Integrated Annual Report 2021-22Standalone Financial Statements  |  371\\nNotes forming part of Standalone Financial Statementsthe Company is acting as the principal or as an agent of the customer. \\nThe Company recognises revenue in the gross amount of consideration \\nwhen it is acting as a principal and at net amount of consideration when it \\nis acting as an agent.\\n Revenue is measured based on the transaction price, which is the consideration, adjusted for volume discounts, service level credits, \\nperformance bonuses, price concessions and incentives, if any, as specified in \\nthe contract with the customer. Revenue also excludes taxes collected from customers.\\n The Company’s contracts with customers could include promises to transfer \\nmultiple products and services to a customer. The Company assesses the \\nproducts / services promised in a contract and identifies distinct performance obligations in the contract. Identification of distinct performance obligation involves judgement to determine the deliverables and the ability of the \\ncustomer to benefit independently from such deliverables.\\n Judgement is also required to determine the transaction price for the \\ncontract and to ascribe the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation. The transaction price could be either a fixed amount of customer consideration or variable consideration with elements such as volume \\ndiscounts, service level credits, performance bonuses, price concessions and \\nincentives. The transaction price is also adjusted for the effects of the time value of money if the contract includes a significant financing component. Any consideration payable to the customer is adjusted to the transaction price, \\nunless it is a payment for a distinct product or service from the customer. The \\nestimated amount of variable consideration is adjusted in the transaction price only to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur and is reassessed \\nat the end of each reporting period. The Company allocates the elements of variable considerations to all the performance obligations of the contract \\nunless there is observable evidence that they pertain to one or more distinct \\nperformance obligations.\\n The Company exercises judgement in determining whether the performance \\nobligation is satisfied at a point in time or over a period of time. The Company considers indicators such as how customer consumes benefits as services \\nare rendered or who controls the asset as it is being created or existence \\nof enforceable right to payment for performance to date and alternate use of such product or service, transfer of significant risks and rewards to the customer, acceptance of delivery by the customer, etc.\\n Revenue from subsidiaries is recognised based on transaction price which is at arm’s length.\\n Contract fulfilment costs are generally expensed as incurred except for certain software licence costs which meet the criteria for capitalisation. Such costs are \\namortised over the contractual period or useful life of licence, whichever is \\nless. The assessment of this criteria requires the application of judgement, in particular when considering if costs generate or enhance resources to be used to satisfy future performance obligations and whether costs are expected to be recovered.\\n Contract assets are recognised when there are excess of revenues earned over billings on contracts. Contract assets are classified as unbilled receivables (only act of invoicing is pending) when there is unconditional right to receive \\ncash, and only passage of time is required, as per contractual terms.\\n Unearned and deferred revenue (“contract liability”) is recognised when there \\nare billings in excess of revenues.Integrated Annual Report 2021-22Standalone Financial Statements  |  372\\nNotes forming part of Standalone Financial Statements The billing schedules agreed with customers include periodic performance \\nbased payments and / or milestone based progress payments. Invoices are \\npayable within contractually agreed credit period.\\n In accordance with Ind AS 37, the Company recognises an onerous contract \\nprovision when the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under a contract exceed the economic benefits to be received.\\n Contracts are subject to modification to account for changes in contract specification and requirements. The Company reviews modification to contract in conjunction with the original contract, basis which the transaction price could be allocated to a new performance obligation, or transaction price of an \\nexisting obligation could undergo a change. In the event transaction price is \\nrevised for existing obligation, a cumulative adjustment is accounted for.\\n The Company disaggregates revenue from contracts with customers by nature of services, industry verticals and geography.\\n Revenue disaggregation by nature of services is as follows:\\n(` crore)\\nY ear ended \\nMarch 31, 2022Y ear ended \\nMarch 31, 2021\\nConsultancy services 1,59,106 1,34,585\\nSale of equipment and software licences  1,235  1,378 \\n1,60,341 1,35,963 Revenue disaggregation by industry vertical is as follows:\\n(` crore)\\nY ear ended \\nMarch 31, 2022Y ear ended \\nMarch 31, 2021\\nBanking, Financial Services and Insurance  58,614  51,189 \\nManufacturing  14,576  11,747 \\nRetail and Consumer Business  26,966  22,219 \\nCommunication, Media and T echnology  28,778  24,243 \\nLife Sciences and Healthcare  18,341  14,920 \\nOthers  13,066  11,645 \\n1,60,341 1,35,963\\n Revenue disaggregation by geography is as follows:\\n(` crore)\\nY ear ended \\nMarch 31, 2022Y ear ended \\nMarch 31, 2021\\nAmericas\\n North Ame rica  90,630  76,510 \\n Latin America  314  288 \\nEurope\\n United Kingdom  27,595  22,913 \\n Continental Europe  17,595  15,364 \\nAsia Pacific  11,178  9,839 \\nIndia  9,547  8,102 \\nMiddle East and Africa  3,482  2,947 \\n1,60,341 1,35,963\\n Geographical revenue is allocated based on the location of the customers.Integrated Annual Report 2021-22Standalone Financial Statements  |  373\\nNotes forming part of Standalone Financial Statements Information about major customers\\n No single customer represents 10% or more of the Company’s total revenue \\nduring the years ended March 31, 2022 and 2021.\\n While disclosing the aggregate amount of transaction price yet to be recognised as revenue towards unsatisfied (or partially) satisfied performance obligations, along with the broad time band for the expected time to recognise \\nthose revenues, the Company has applied the practical expedient in  \\nInd AS 115. Accordingly, the Company has not disclosed the aggregate transaction price allocated to unsatisfied (or partially satisfied) performance obligations which pertain to contracts where revenue recognised corresponds to the value transferred to customer typically involving time and material, \\noutcome based and event based contracts.\\n Unsatisfied (or partially satisfied) performance obligations are subject to variability due to several factors such as terminations, changes in scope of \\ncontracts, periodic revalidations of the estimates, economic factors (changes in currency rates, tax laws etc).

Deferred income taxes\\n Deferred income tax is recognised using the balance sheet approach. Deferred \\nincome tax assets and liabilities are recognised for deductible and taxable temporary differences arising between the tax base of assets and liabilities and \\ntheir carrying amount, except when the deferred income tax arises from the \\ninitial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss at the time of the transaction.\\n Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary \\ndifferences and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses \\ncan be utilised.\\n The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised.\\n Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using substantively enacted tax \\nrates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the temporary \\ndifferences are expected to be received or settled.\\n For operations carried out in SEZs, deferred tax assets or liabilities, if any, have been established for the tax consequences of those temporary differences \\nbetween the carrying values of assets and liabilities and their respective tax \\nbases that reverse after the tax holiday ends.Integrated Annual Report 2021-22Standalone Financial Statements  |  385\\nNotes forming part of Standalone Financial Statements Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes \\nlevied by the same taxation authority and the relevant entity intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.\\n Deferred tax assets include Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) paid in accordance \\nwith the tax laws in India, to the extent it would be available for set off against \\nfuture current income tax liability. Accordingly, MAT is recognised as deferred tax asset in the balance sheet when the asset can be measured reliably and it is probable that the future economic benefit associated with the asset will be \\nrealised.\\n The income tax expense consists of the following:\\n(` crore)\\nY ear ended \\nMarch 31, 2022Y ear ended \\nMarch 31, 2021\\nCurrent tax\\nCurrent tax expense for current year  12,912  10,404 \\nCurrent tax benefit pertaining to prior years  (981)  (104)\\n 11,931  10,300 \\nDeferred tax\\nDeferred tax benefit for current year  (395)  (294)\\nDeferred tax benefit pertaining to prior years  -     (64)\\n (395)  (358)\\n 11,536  9,942  The reconciliation of estimated income tax expense at statutory income tax \\nrate to income tax expense reported in statement of profit and loss is as follows:\\n(` crore)\\nY ear ended \\nMarch 31, 2022Y ear ended \\nMarch 31, 2021\\nProfit before taxes  49,723  40,902 \\nIndian statutory income tax rate 34.94% 34.94%\\nExpected income tax expense  17,375  14,293 \\nTax effect of adjustments to reconcile \\nexpected income tax expense to reported income tax expense\\nTax holidays  (4,604)  (4,708)\\nIncome exempt from tax  (1,240)  (773)\\nUndistributed earnings in branches  (232)  26 \\nTax on income at different rates  1,107  1,103 \\nTax pertaining to prior years  (981)  (168)\\nOthers (net)  111  169 \\nTotal income tax expense\\n 11,536  9,942 \\n The Company benefits from the tax holiday available for units set up under \\nthe Special Economic Zone Act, 2005.

        "raw_text = '''On Halloween, Gotham City mayor Don Mitchell Jr. is murdered by the Riddler, a masked serial killer. Reclusive billionaire Bruce Wayne, who has operated for two years as the vigilante Batman, investigates the murder alongside the Gotham City Police Department (GCPD). Lieutenant James Gordon discovers a message that the Riddler left for Batman. The following night, the Riddler kills Commissioner Pete Savage and leaves another message for Batman.\n",
        "\n",
        "Batman and Gordon discover that the Riddler left a thumb drive in Mitchell's car containing images of Mitchell with a woman, Annika Kosolov, at the Iceberg Lounge—a nightclub operated by Oswald \"The Penguin\" Cobblepot, crime boss Carmine Falcone's lieutenant. While the Penguin pleads ignorance, Batman notices that Selina Kyle, Annika's roommate, works at the club as a waitress. When Annika disappears, Batman sends Selina to the Iceberg Lounge for answers and discovers that Savage was on Falcone's payroll, as is district attorney Gil Colson.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Riddler abducts Colson, straps a timed collar bomb to his neck, and sends him to interrupt Mitchell's funeral. When Batman arrives, the Riddler calls him via Colson's phone and threatens to detonate the bomb if Colson cannot answer three riddles. Colson refuses to answer the third—the name of the informant who gave the GCPD information that led to a historic drug bust ending gangster Salvatore Maroni's operation—and is killed. Batman and Gordon deduce that the informant may be the Penguin and track him to a drug deal. They discover that Maroni's operation transferred to Falcone, with many corrupt GCPD officers involved. Selina inadvertently exposes them when she arrives to steal money and discovers Annika's corpse in the trunk of a car. After a car chase, Batman captures the Penguin, but he and Gordon learn the Penguin is not the informant.\n",
        "\n",
        "Batman and Gordon follow the Riddler's trail to the ruins of an orphanage funded by Bruce's murdered parents, Thomas and Martha Wayne, where they learn that the Riddler holds a grudge against the Wayne family. Bruce's butler and caretaker, Alfred Pennyworth, is hospitalized after opening a letter bomb addressed to Bruce. The Riddler leaks evidence that Thomas, who was running for mayor before he was murdered, hired Falcone to kill a journalist who was writing a story about Martha's family history of mental illness. Bruce confronts Alfred, who maintains that Thomas only asked Falcone to threaten the journalist into silence; Thomas planned to turn himself and Falcone over to the police once he found out Falcone murdered the journalist instead. Alfred believes that Falcone had Thomas and Martha killed to silence them.\n",
        "\n",
        "Selina reveals to Batman that Falcone is her father. After learning that he killed Annika for discovering he was the informant, she tries to kill Falcone, but Batman and Gordon arrive in time to stop her. Gordon arrests Falcone, but the Riddler kills him with a sniper rifle moments later. The Riddler is unmasked as forensic accountant Edward Nashton and incarcerated in Arkham State Hospital, where he tells Batman he took inspiration from him when targeting the corrupt. Batman learns that Nashton has planted car bombs around Gotham and cultivated an online following that plans to assassinate mayor-elect Bella Reál.\n",
        "\n",
        "The bombs destroy the seawall around Gotham and flood the city. Nashton's followers attempt to kill Reál, but Batman and Selina manage to stop them. In the aftermath, Nashton befriends another inmate,[a] while Selina deems Gotham beyond saving and leaves. Batman aids recovery efforts and vows to inspire hope in Gotham.'''"
